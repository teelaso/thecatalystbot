	"“Hey, Tech. Would you mind running to the store to get heavy cream?” Phil asked, looking up from his phone. “I managed to forget it. I’ll give you a ten, get something for yourself too.”",
	"\\[Techno’s room\\] was dark and for the most part, monochromatic. Grey sheets with grey pillows, grey blinds and white carpet. The LEDs on his walls were pink, though, which cast a pink light through the whole room. His blinds were shut, and clothes littered the floor.",
	"Techno laid down on the bed with a sigh. His popcorn ceilings had patterns if he looked close enough.",
	"“Oh, perfect timing. I just finished icing the cake.” Phil smiled, showing it off to Techno. \n\nIt read, “Happy Birthday Tobby”. \n\nTechno snorted. “You spelled Toby wrong.”", 
	"He changed into black jeans and a T-shirt with a smiley face on it. It had been a normal T-shirt once, but he had hung out with Dream and his friends a few weeks ago, and now all of them had smiley face T-shirts. It was drawn on with a sharpie. He liked it.",
	"“Shit. Fuck. Don’t tell Phil?”", 
	"“You’re a natural”, Wilbur joked.\n\n“I think that’s a bad thing.” Techno said, blowing smoke out into the night air.\n\nWilbur was quiet for a moment. “Yeah, probably.”",
	"“I mean it makes sense, given today.” Wilbur said, rubbing the side of his arm to warm it up.\n\n“What do you mean?” Techno asked, looking over at Wilbur.\n\nWilbur looked back at him. “What... what do you mean ‘what do you mean’. It’s the day before Christmas.”",
	"“You know I… like… care about you, right? You’re my friend. I wanna make sure you’re okay.”",
	"“Mhm. Hey, Techno?”\n\nHe paused. “Yeah? What?”\n\n“Sweet dreams. I love you.”", 
		
	"Josh L.\n23\nLooking for someone special. 🍃 and booze friendly. Heteroflexible, open to almost anything. Hmu, I talk back :D",
	"“You were there last night too. Are you planning on spending the rest of winter break there?” He asked.\n\nWilbur bristled and gritted his teeth, a sudden anger rising in him. “Jesus, I dunno! Maybe? Why do you care?”",
	"“God, you’re somehow even more beautiful in person. Come on in, the sushi just got here. Would you like a glass of wine?”\n\nMentally, Wilbur fist pumped. Free alcohol. Always a win. Almost erased the discomfort of the gendered compliment.",
	"“Yeah, I’m…” Wilbur trailed off as he felt his body sink backwards into the couch, and his vision started to lag. “Good.”",
	"“Aw, come on, I’ve barely seen you recently!” Tommy said, pulling his sleeve.\n\nWilbur froze, then yanked his hand away from his younger brother. “Don’t fucking touch me, Tommy!”",
	"He was quiet. He was very, very careful to be quiet. His whole body felt like it was on fire.",

	"The world was beginning to sway pleasantly, and Wilbur capped the bottle and returned it to the space under his bed frame. He took a deep breath and pulled out his phone. It was only 10:34 AM. He laughed a little at that, this was definitely the earliest he’d gotten plastered.",
	"It felt wrong. That was the closest way he could think to describe it. It felt deeply, terribly wrong.",
	"He pulled at his binder a little, making sure it was still in place. It felt comforting to him, like a shield that would keep unwanted touches away. The pressure he had always found annoying felt safe now.",
	"It happened in a flash- Tommy tried to hit his hands away, Wilbur’s rage sparked, and the next thing he felt was the palm of his hand stinging his brother’s face.",
	"Wilbur screamed, the feeling of hands on him sending fire through his veins. He writhed against his brother’s grip, shrieking and kicking and sobbing profanities.",
	"“Why did you hit Tommy?” Techno asked, eyeing Wilbur carefully.\n\n“I’m… ‘m not drunk”, he sniffled, pulling his beanie over his hair.\n\n“Wilbur, I’m gonna be honest, if you hit Tommy while completely sober, I’m gonna break your fuckin’ ribs. You better have an explanation.”",
	"“I’m really sorry, Tommy”, he mumbled.\n\nTommy looked at him with a mix of sympathy and cautiousness. “It’s… it’s okay. Just don’t do it again”, he said, taking a shaky breath.\n\nWilbur nodded. “Never.”",
	"By the time school started up again a few days later, his brothers had gotten used to an almost permanent state of drunkenness from Wilbur.",
	"“I’m not drunk, I’m just tired. Gimme.”\n\n“I can literally see a bottle of vodka in your backpack”",
	"“Tommy, get out.” He deadpanned.\n\nTommy shook his head.\n\n“Tommy, get out of the car. This isn’t safe.” Techno ordered.\n\nTommy shook his head again. “If Wilbur wants to die he has to kill me too.”",
	"“No! You’re going to get in a car accident and you’re going to die, if you die I want to die too!”",
	"“I don’t need you guys to be worried about me! I’m fucking fine, now get out of the car!” Wilbur yelled, glaring at Tommy.\n\n“No! I’m not going to let you kill yourself!” He cried, backing away from Wilbur even further.\n\n“Why not?!” Wilbur shouted.",
	"The car was loud, Tommy and Tubbo’s shrieks of laughter bouncing off the walls. A keen eye could tell Tommy was more reserved than usual, and a thin layer of tension surrounded the brothers.",
	"He took long swigs, desperately, and took a few deep breaths to let the feeling wash over him. It was okay. He was safe. He didn’t have to think about it if he couldn’t think.",
	"“Don’t ever drive drunk again. Even tipsy.” He said, holding out his pinky finger. “For me and Tommy. Please.”\n\nWilbur felt the words sink and weigh down his chest, but he nodded and pinky swore. “I promise”",
	"Wilbur sat alone in his room, staring at his phone. The room was dark, his usually minimalist design a wreck of dirty clothes and trash. ",
	"He took a deep breath, feeling the pressure of his binder reassure him.\n\nAlone in his room, he could almost forget the feeling of another man’s hands on his chest.\n\nAlmost.",
 
	"“Should I be worried about you?” Schlatt asked, glancing up from his phone.\n\n“No”, Wilbur scowled.",
	"Schlatt made eye contact with him, then. Wilbur wished he hadn’t. Schlatt was the only person left that he thought wouldn’t judge him. The look on his face proved otherwise.",				
	"D&D is today.” Wilbur said, readjusting his beanie.\n\n“Ah, is this the one where you all have countries?” Phil grinned.\n\nWilbur scoffed. “Yeah, well, we used to. Tommy and Techno and I have a refuge, but Schlatt kicked us out.",
	"“Tommy, am I a- am I a bad- am I a villain?” Wilbur asked, his voice breaking at the words.\n\nTommy paused, looking at his brother. He hesitated, watching the glint of honesty in Wilbur’s eyes.\n\n“No.”\n\n“Why not?”",
	"He looked like he was asking for something like he was asking for forgiveness. Tommy blinked and shook his head, trying to reset his brain. This wasn’t about real life. This was fictional, if Wilbur wanted to have this conversation, he would need to take it seriously.",
	"Just like that, the honesty dissipated from Wilbur’s eyes. He was back in character. He slipped back into his role with ease, the break going unnoticed by everyone else at the table.\n\nTommy almost despised him for it.",
	"“You’re not a bad guy, Wilbur.” Tommy was the first to speak.\n\nWilbur tensed. He kept his eyes on the road.\n“That was just my character, Toms.”\n\n“Was it?”\n\n“Does it matter?”\n\n“I feel like it does.”\n\n“Well, it doesn’t.”",
	"”Just because we’re related by some stupid fucking legal documents doesn’t mean you get to know every little detail of my fucking life, okay? Christ!”",
	"He punched his wall until his knuckles were red and bloody. He didn’t even make a dent.",

	"Techno hated the silence that followed. Dream was warm, and what had felt comforting seconds ago felt like hot shame now.",
	"He always hated silence with Dream. He loved it on his own, but with Dream it came with anger. An anger that settled on his skin like a layer of ash, fallen from a plume of smoke.",
	"“It didn’t feel like I was puttin’ smoke in my lungs, it felt like I was lettin’ smoke out for the first time.”",
	"“Do you ever get that feelin’? Like there used to be a fire inside you, but now it’s just smouldering away? Fillin’ you up with smoke?",
	"Dream watched a plane overhead. Tiny blinking lights, quietly crossing the sky.\n\n“No, the only time I feel the fire inside me is when someone pours in gasoline. Then I feel it through my whole body.”",
	"“I think you’re like the sun.”\n\n“One day I’m gonna explode and kill everyone?” Dream teased.\n\nTechno scoffed. “No, you’re… fiery. You’re full of passion. I think you’re so full of emotions it burns you.”",
	"“What would that make you?”\n\n“I think that would make me dark matter.”\n\n“Blocking out the stars?”\n\n“Not intentionally. It’s just in my nature”",
	"Techno studied his friend’s face. In the dark, illuminated only by the moon, his green eyes looked grey. His freckles looked like stars. Techno wished he could live among those stars.",
	"Dream returned the favor. Techno’s face was round like the moon, chubby cheeks and hooded eyelids framing dark brown eyes.",
	"“It’s rainin’.” Techno said.\n\n“We should go inside”, Dream said.\n\nThe two did not go inside. Techno rested his forehead on Dream’s, closing his eyes.",
	"“Do you believe in it?”\n\n“What, sausages?”\n\nTechno scoffed. “No, like, Christianity.”",
	"“I don’t believe in the bible, no. I do believe there’s a god, though.”\n\n“Do you think he’s kind?” Techno asked.\n\nDream didn’t have an answer for that.",
	"“You’re welcome to stay until Phil can pick you up.”\n\n“I can’t say I’ll be very entertainin’.”\n\n“I’m not friends with you for entertainment, Techno.”",
	"“Thank you, Techno. I love you.”\n\n“…I love you too, dad.”",
	"“Wilbur doesn’t hate you.”\n\n“H-He said that we’re only related because of some papers”, Tommy sobbed, leaning into Techno’s touch.\n\nTechno felt the fire in his body ignite. He gritted his teeth. “Do you want me to beat him up?”\n\n“No, I j-just want him to love me!”",
	"As the car drove away, Techno’s expression fell. Then it kept falling, until all that was left was a snarl and a fire behind his eyes.",
	"Wilbur struggled against him. “Fucking let me go, you idiot! It’s the truth!”\n\nWith those words, Wilbur poured gasoline on the fire.",
	"“Aren’t we your brothers?! How could you say that? He loves you more than he loves himself, and you fuckin’ crushed him!”",
	"“You’re a fucking psychopath, Techno. You’re sick.”",
	"Techno stood, heavy breaths shaking his body. He wiped his eyes, leaving a smear of blood on his cheek. The weight of what he’d done started to sink in, and he started to feel sick.",

	"Wilbur, stop. Look at me.” Phil held him still, looking in his eyes. Steady, unwavering green against neurotic, desperate brown.",
	"Phil felt his heart break in two. He pulled Wilbur closer, holding him tight. “I’m so sorry, Wil. God, I’m so sorry.”",
	"I know what you mean about gasoline on the fire now though",
	"His hands were still stained with his brother's blood.",
	"Techno felt the stinging pain well into his dreams.",
	"“Wilbur?”\n\nNo response came.\n\n“Wilbur, can I come in?”\n\nNothing.\n\nHe opened the door cautiously, peering inside the dark room. He turned the light on, and his heart sank.\n\nA gentle breeze blew through the open window.",

	"“Run away with me.”\n\n“You lost your fuckin’ mind, man.”\n\n“Just for a week or two, Schlatt, please. I can’t go home.”",
	"“It doesn’t matter, Schlatt!” Wilbur laughed, high and manic. “Come on! We’ll have the week of our lives! We can sleep on the beach, we can do whatever we want!”",
	"The moon hung in the sky like a mother, watching the two boys on the cliff’s edge. Black waves crashed against the rocks far below, a dull but textured noise in the air.",
	"“You’re not gay, right?” Wilbur’s words were slurred, tumbling out of his mouth like pills he found he regretted.\n\n“I dunno. I got better things to think about.”",
	"Did you ever consider you might be a kinda shitty friend?” Schlatt’s tone wasn’t angry. It was hurt.",
	"Why d’you keep me around if I’m that bad?” Wilbur tried to meet his eye again, but Schlatt turned away.\n\n“I dunno. You’re all I got.”",
	"“No, Wilbur, I’m not your fucking dealer. That would require you actually paying me for the shit I give you.”\n\nWilbur stared up at him. “Why do you gimme stuff f’r free? You don’ do that with anyone else.”",
	"The moon took away the color in the world, painting everything dark shades of blue and grey. It was big and full that night, beckoning him out to sea.",
	"Schlatt looked up at the cliff’s edge, and thoughts of Wilbur flooded his brain. He scowled.\n\nWhen it was hard to move his body from the numbness, he waded back out to shore.\n\nNo one needed to know if he found warmth again in the arms of his friend.",
	"“Fucking shut up, Wilbur!” Schlatt shouted, stunning Wilbur into silence. “Just shut your fucking trap for once in your life!”\n\nWilbur stared like a deer in the headlights, his heart racing.",
	"I don’t wanna talk to you until you can act like a person. I’m serious.” Schlatt made eye contact with him then. Wilbur really, really wished he hadn’t.\n\n“I… I am a person”, he whispered, tears stinging his eyes.\n\n“No, Wilbur. You’re cyanide.”",
	"“No, Wilbur. You’re cyanide.”",
	"Wilbur stood still, watching Schlatt walk away. He didn’t look back once.",
	"He heard the dull sounds of Phil talking to him, Phil crying, the grey feeling of Phil hugging him and begging him to tell him where it all went wrong.",
	"Pink hair and sharp brown eyes cut through the fog. Techno was staring at him.\n\nWilbur stared back.",
	"When Wilbur’s eyes fluttered open the next morning, he could almost convince himself it was all a bad dream. Then the headache hit, and when he reached under his bed for help, he found nothing.",
	"Wilbur’s eyes widened as he watched Phil use the key to a padlock on the medicine cabinet. That had not been there previously.\n\n“Is that really necessary?” Wilbur asked, his voice small.\n\nPhil stopped, then sighed. “Wilbur, I don’t want you to talk to me about what’s ‘necessary’.",
	"“Sit down. I know you were… hungover, or in shock, or something last night, so you weren’t very good at talking. You don’t have an excuse today.” Phil said, pointing to the couch.\n\nWilbur did as he was told.",

	"It was fairly neat as far as teenager’s rooms went, a yellow duvet on their bed and houseplants dotting the surfaces. Tommy’s stuff was crammed in a corner.",
	"The shirt was one of Techno’s, a souvenir from the Welcome to Night Vale show he’d attended a few years back. Tommy had gotten into it after Techno went, and as Techno’s hyperfixation moved on, Tommy was rewarded with all of Techno’s merch.",
	"“What the fuck is wrong with you?”\n\nThe lump in his throat grew, a pit formed in his stomach, and tears stung his eyes. “I’m sorry. I don’t know.”",
	"Techno watched him go. The world lost a little more color.",
	"He was quiet, far quieter than he usually was. A raging storm brewed inside him, tearing at his body and mind.",
	"“Okay”, Tubbo smiled, “you’re always welcome to stay as long as you like.”",
	"”You let me know if you need anything, alright little man?” Eret offered a warm smile.\n\nTommy scowled. “I’m not little.”\n\nEret and Tubbo both laughed, quiet things in the dead of night.",
	"“I don’t want to go to therapy.” Tommy grumbled, burying his face in Tubbo’s shoulder again.\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“I don’t want someone in my head. That’s scary.”\n\n“They only go in to help you heal.”\n\n“Maybe I don’t want to heal.”",

	"Every so often, his thoughts would stray from whatever meaningless content he was looking at and he would feel the world start to collapse around him.",
	"Techno couldn’t imagine it was easy, watching your son go through withdrawals for nicotine and alcohol at the same time. Knowing you hadn't even noticed it get this bad.",
	"Breaking his nose certainly hadn’t helped.\n\nNo, it had definitely made things worse.",
	"Techno would ball his fist sometimes, feel the wave of guilt that came with the simple gesture drown him.",
	"It became a routine, every night he would pray that his blood would heal his brother. It never did.",
	"“The Blade”, used to be Tommy’s nickname for him. He laughed a little at that. How morbid.",
	"Why did it hurt so much when someone knew? He felt numb while he did it, why did it feel like someone was ripping out his heart when Dream asked that?",
	"“How the hell did you do that?” Techno asked, offering him a hand and pulling him in.\n\n“I do parkour in my free time. I go rock climbing twice a year. I have the natural agility of a cat. Take your pick.”",
	"“I don’t need you to take care of me.”\n\n“I want to take care of you.” Dream insisted, meeting his eyes.\n\n“It’s rotten work”, Techno said, his voice a whisper around the lump in his throat.\n\n“Not to me”, Dream said, taking his hand. “Not if it’s you.”",
	"Dream slipped out of his window in the early morning, pale light illuminating the quiet world. The city was still damp, the clouds having moved on but left their mark.",
	"“You look tired”, Fundy said, acknowledging Techno for the first time.\n\n“Oh… yeah, I didn’t sleep last night.” Techno nodded.\n\n“Insomnia?” Fundy asked, looking over at Techno in the passenger seat.\n\nDream’s dark green and yellow eyes flashed in his mind. “Something like that.”",
	"“Techno, you can walk home, right?”\n\nTechno sighed and stood up, pulling his backpack over his shoulder. “Sure. Why not”, he mumbled.\n\n“I’m sure we can give him a-“\n\n“No, shh. He’s an arsehole, let him walk.”",
	"Techno tried not to hear it. He put his headphones in and started on his way home, trying to ignore the stinging in his thighs and the feeling of the world threatening to collapse around him.",
	"“You did this to me! You’re a fucking piece of shit, you know that, Technoblade?! You’re a fucking psychopath and you only care about yourself! You broke my fucking nose, you ruined my life!”",
	"“All you do is hurt people. You should've gone through with it.”",
	"Techno felt the world collapse around him.",

	"3:24AM\nwilbur: i miss you\n\n2:12PM\nwilbur: im sorry\n\ni wasn't trying to hurt you",
	"(Not Delivered)wilbur: fuxk you\n\nError: Your message could not be delivered because you don't share a server with the recipient or you disabled direct messages on your shared server, recipient is only accepting direct messages from friends, or you were blocked by the recipient.",
	"Wilbur buried his face in his pillow and screamed, hot tears staining the sheet. He sobbed, loud and painful cries muffled by a thin layer of padding.",
	"There was a black hole inside him. There had to be. Nothing else could explain this pain, this craving.",
	"JustaMinx: I’m gonna block you if you keep saying shit like this\n\nwilbur: go ahead you’re useless to me\n\nJustaMinx: You’re fucked in the head\n\n(Not Delivered)wilbur: yeah. i know",
	"Eventually, Phil came into his room. Wilbur had never seen him so… grey. So serious.",
	"Phil stared at his eldest son. “What is wrong with you?”\n\n“Everything, obviously.”",
	"“What are you gonna do? What the fuck could you do that would affect me in the slightest? My life is in fucking shambles, Phil!” Wilbur yelled. “I don’t care! Do whatever you fucking want! Kill me!”",
	"“Wilbur, you’re not the first alcoholic in the world.”",
	"“Give me your phone, and we can pretend these aren’t withdrawals. We can pretend I didn’t find empty vodka bottles under your bed, we can pretend I didn’t find cigarettes in your bedside table. We can pretend you didn’t run away for a night and come home hungover!”",
	"“You know what we’re not going to do, though? We are not going to pretend you didn’t just tell your brother to kill himself, Wilbur!”",
	"Wilbur blinked back tears, staring at his father and reminding himself again and again that Phil was different, Phil wouldn’t hurt him.",
	"“Wilbur Soot Watson, give me your phone, or I will take it from you!” Phil shouted, his voice filled with more rage and grief than Wilbur had ever heard before.",
	"Phil looked at him. Wilbur couldn’t place the emotion his expression conveyed- something somewhere between betrayal, pity, and mourning.",

	"He knew this was his last stronghold before institutionalization. He knew Phil was just as scared as he was. Techno knew he couldn’t get institutionalized- that would solidify it. It would make everything real.",
	"“Freja, have you ever self-harmed?” He asked, voice innocuous as if he hadn’t just sentenced him to the guillotine.",
	"Techno stared at the carpet. It was the plastic type of carpet, flat and hard. Grey, just like everything else.",
	"“Techno?” Phil spoke up.\n\n“…yeah?” He mumbled, not meeting his eye.\n\n“Why didn’t you come to me?” He asked. His voice was soft, quiet like Techno had never seen before.\n\nTechno felt his throat tighten again. He shrugged. “Didn’t wanna bother ya.”",
	"“Techno, I always want you to come to me when you need me. I love you more than anything in the world. You’re my son, and you will never, ever bother me, okay?”",
	"“I know it hurts”, Phil said, his own voice strained, “It hurts like nothing else right now, but I promise it won’t always hurt. I promise you, I promise it won’t always hurt. It’ll be okay one day, Techno. I swear to you.”",
	"“One day, you’re going to find the beauty in life again. You’ll laugh again, you’ll feel safe again. I promise. You have to promise you’ll hold on for that. Promise me, Techno. Promise you’ll hold on for the good days.”",
	"“You’re my world, Techno. You’re my heart. I don’t know what I would ever do without you.”",
	"It was the first time he’d felt loved- really, truly loved- in years.",
	"“I’ll put in a note saying you prefer Wilbur.” The doctor said, turning to his computer.\n\nWilbur gritted his teeth. “Prefer” his ass. It was just his name. No preference about it.",
	"“I’m not fucking psychotic”, Wilbur snarled. “I’m not- I’m not fucking bipolar! I know bipolar, my dad was bipolar, I’m not fucking like him!”",

	"“You guys are weird. I dunno. You both get really mad and sad and stuff all the time. I don’t understand how you think. It’s like you have different rules for interacting with people.”",
	"“Am I a bad person?” Wilbur asked, his voice cracking. Tommy and Techno exchanged a nervous glance. What the hell were they supposed to say to that?",
	"“I think… you do bad things. You say bad stuff. But I don’t think you’re a bad person.”",
	"“My dad was bipolar”, Wilbur said.\n\nIt took them both a second to realise he wasn’t talking about Phil. Both of them had been adopted when they were little kids, but Wilbur hadn’t been welcomed into the family until he was twelve.",
	"“Your first dad?” Techno asked.\n\n“Yeah”, Wilbur mumbled. “He was a f-fucking piece of shit. I don’t…” his throat closed up. “I don’t want to be like him.”",
	"“That’s a choice, Wilbur. It doesn’t matter if you have the same disorder as him. It’s your job to be better.”",
	"“You could start by apologisin’ to us.” Techno deadpanned, a glare settling into his eyes.\n\n“H-Have I wronged you?” Wilbur asked, his voice cracking on every word.\n\nTechno laughed. “Christ, Wilbur.",
	"Wilbur watched them go. His felt his heart grow a little heavier.",
	"“Soot, I’m gonna give you five more seconds to fuck off before I do something drastic.” Schlatt said, reaching into his inner jacket.",
	"“It doesn’t matter. Go back to them, Niki. I don’t want to hurt you too.”\n\n“You aren’t going to hurt me, Wil.”\n\n“Yes, I am!”",
	"“I’m a piece of shit, I’m an arsehole, can’t you tell?! Go back to Schlatt and Minx, Niki. Before I make you regret not listening to me.”",
	"“You… y-you’re not a bad person, Wil. This isn’t you.”\n\n“This is the only me that’s left.”",
	"“I don’t believe that.”\n\n“You should. Your blindness will be the death of you.”",
	"“Holy shit, Wilbur. You’re like, an adult, you know that, right? You know you’re eighteen? You can legally vote? You’re gonna tattle on me to our dad because I’m not lettin’ you sit with me at lunch?”",
	"Wilbur stared at him for a moment longer. Thought about taking Schlatt’s gun and putting it right between his eyes. Thought about the way his brains would splatter against the shattered back window.\nHe blinked and shook his head, pushing those thoughts out of his mind.",
	"He knew the right thing to do was to tell Phil.\n\nHe also knew that he slightly less moral thing- blackmail- would secure him a steady stream of Xanax.",
	"Do we have a deal?” He offered his hand.\n\nTechno looked between his brother- his brother, who was threatening him- and his outstretched hand. He took it and shook.\n“Yeah, we… we have a deal.”",
	"“I love you, Technoblade.” Wilbur said, his words sweet as cyanide.\n\nHe stared up at him. “I… I love you too, Wilbur.”\n\n“Good.”",

	"He glanced at Techno and felt a little spark of fear at his expression. He’d seen that expression a few times before. It was the equivalent of a giant red sign that read, “DANGER”.",
	"It felt a little silly, really, considering Tommy was nearly half a foot taller than him. He was just… intimidating. Despite his short disposition.",
	"“Wait, why is Tommy here? Schlatt, you can’t trade one Watson out for another.”",
	"“Since when does Schlatt give a shit about anyone but Wilbur?”",

	"“Wilbur, do you wanna hang out?” He knocked again. Nothing. He cautiously opened the door and peeked inside.\n\nHis heart froze in its place.\n\nWilbur was laying on the ground, eyes open, unblinking.",
	"Wilbur was laying on the ground, eyes open, unblinking.",
	"“Wilbur, what- what are you doing?! What did you do?!”",
	"He sat in the waiting room alone. He had never been inside a hospital before. He felt severely out of place. None of this should have been happening. None of this was supposed to happen.\n\nWas any of this happening?",
	"“This doesn’t feel real”, he said, his voice hardly a whisper.\n\nSchlatt gritted his teeth. What the fuck was he supposed to say to that?\n“Uh… it is, sorry, bud.”",
	"“You got him hooked on fuckin’ benzos? Christ, this is gonna be awful.”",
	"“I’m sorry”, Techno whispered. “I’m sorry. I was bein’ a coward. I’m sorry.”",
	"“Wh-What if I hadn’t found him, Techno?!”",
	"Schlatt didn’t have the heart to tell him there were things a lot harder than Xanax",
	"Schlatt’s car smelled like cigarettes and cheap car fresheners. It made Tommy feel sick.",
	"Every time he closed his eyes he could see his lifeless eyes, smell the acrid vomit.",
	"“Can I have one?” Techno asked, his voice cracking and raw.\n\nSchlatt eyed him over. “As long as you don’t make it a habit, sure.” He took one out of the box and handed it to Techno as well as his lighter. Techno read the box- Newport Menthols.",
	"“Don’t follow in Wilbur’s footsteps, man. It’s just a bad path to go down.”\n\n“Why did you let him then?”",
	"“It just made him happy at first. I liked seein’ him happy. Then it got bad. It always gets bad.",
	"“Everything he did was his choice. They were choices made outta desperation, sure, of course they were, but that doesn’t mean you’re at fault for being manipulated. He screwed you over, okay? He took advantage of you.”",
	"“I almost killed him”, Techno said, his voice a quiet, broken rasp.\n\n“No, dude, he almost killed himself. You were just someone he fucked over in the process.”",
	"“I think Wilbur was right about me.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“I’m better off dead.”",

	"Schlatt sighed and stood up, offering his hand. Techno hesitantly took it, and was surprised when the other pulled him up into a tight hug. He was frozen for a moment, but then he felt Schlatt’s hand gently stroking his hair, and he broke down.",
	"He held it, letting himself feel the cold, hard plastic and metal against his skin. The weight of it made him feel safe. Made the fear subside, even if just for a moment.",
	"They pulled up in front of Dream’s house and parked, waiting for him to come out. The place was huge, two stories, high ceilings and marble countertops. Schlatt had no idea what the kid’s parents did for a living, but he couldn’t help being bitterly envious.",
	"Schlatt bit his lip. He’d never had a friendship like that. Him and Wilbur were close, sure, but if Techno and Dream were a flower, Wilbur and Schlatt were the thorns.",
	"The songs cycled from lofi with Tubbo, to video game soundtracks with Tommy, to punk rock with Techno, to folk punk with Dream, and finally to classic rock with Schlatt.",
	"He remembered the way Wilbur had looked at him, his eyes far too honest and open for Schlatt to handle. “Run away with me”, he’d said. All manic grins and wide, bright eyes.",
	"Wilbur wasn’t the type to kill himself without a note. Schlatt knew him too well, he was a drama queen to the very end. He was glad Wilbur had survived, because he knew he would’ve been pissed to die to a stupid mistake like that. It wouldn’t have been poetic enough for him.",
	"No, his death would have to had been a piece of art. A ballet, a painting, a bullet through the head and splatter of blood on a handwritten note.",
	"“You can only deny your brother overdosing for about two hours, apparently.”",
	"“What’s he gonna do? Bite my ankles?” Dream laughed, then he felt something cold between his eyes. His entire body froze as he realised there was a gun to his head.",
	"“Take”, Schlatt met his eyes, “your fuckin’ shoes”, Dream heard a click, “off my dashboard.”",
	"The rest of the ride was silent as the dead. Schlatt let a smirk play on his lips. Not scared of him, his ass.",
	"He needed to see Wilbur. Even if it hurt like a bitch. Even if every time they got close, Wilbur would lash out and wound him.",

	"He felt his body lifted up, and at that moment, the world went black. He faintly wondered if he was dead, if this was what death felt like.",
	"If this was death, death was nothing at all.",
	"It took a moment to set in. He took a breath and let it out. He had almost died.",
	"He had almost died.",
	"Once that clicked, his brain flooded. He had almost died. He hadn’t died. He had overdosed. How was he at the hospital?",
	"“How… How did I get to the hospital?” He asked. Everything in his mind screamed at him. He didn’t want to know. He didn’t want to know.",
	"“Tommy found you, Wilbur.” Phil said, looking into his eyes. Wilbur stared back, eyes wide.\n\n“No. Tell me he didn’t. Tell me it was someone else.”",
	"His eyes were broken glass, his words the blood that leaked.",
	"“Tommy found you.” Phil repeated, his own voice cracking. His eyes were broken glass, his words the blood that leaked.\n\nWilbur let out a sob.",
	"“Wilbur, this has to be the end of this. This has to be where you stop the drinking, and the smoking, and the drugs. Okay?”",
	"“I can help you, okay? I don’t understand the drugs, but, the smoking and the drinking… you can talk to me, okay? I… I know how hard it is.” Phil sighed.\n\nHe finally looked at his father. “You do?”\n\n“Yeah, Wilbur. Like I said, you’re not the first alcoholic in the world.”",
	"“Yeah, Wilbur. Like I said, you’re not the first alcoholic in the world.” Phil said, offering a sad smile with broken eyes.\n\n“But you never drink”, Wilbur mumbled.\n\n“Exactly.”",
	"“I love you, Wilbur. I love you so much.”\n\n“I love you too, dad.”",
	"“Never do that again. Never.”\n\n“I-I know, I’m s-sorry, I-“\n\n“Don’t interrupt me, Wilbur. Never do that again, or I will actually kill you to finish the job.”",
	"“Fuck, I’ve missed you, Jay.”\n\n“Ah-ah. No. You got one first name pass and you used it. Keep that shit out of your mouth.”",
	"Techno watched from a few feet away as the two cried and repeated their love and worry for one another. He wanted to hug Wilbur. He wanted to apologise for letting him take the Xanax. He wanted to apologise for everything he’d ever done.\n\nHe just watched.",
	"He wanted to apologise for everything he’d ever done.\n\nHe just watched.",
	"“So are you gonna change?”\n\nWilbur swallowed the lump in his throat. “I, uh… I guess.”\n\n“That’s not convincing, Soot.”\n\n“I am! I am, I just… I don’t know where to start.”",
	"“I don’t know where to start.”\n\n“Start by apologising.”\n\n“To who?”\n\n“Fucking everyone”",
	"“Promise me. Promise me right fucking now that you’re never gonna get high or drunk again.”\n\nWilbur stared up at his friend. He couldn’t make that promise, it would break too easily.",
	"“I-I promise.”\n\n“What do you promise?”\n\n“I promise I won’t ever get drunk or high again.”",
	"“You’re a fucking wreck, you know that?”\n\nWilbur nodded.",
	"“You are cyanide, Wilbur! You’re fucking poison!”",
	"Wilbur felt the pain shoot through him, and like a catalyst, he felt it stab his heart and mind.",
	"“Can you do that again?”\n\n“What?! What the fuck?! Are you getting off on this?!”",
	"Wilbur looked up at him with obsessive eyes. “I love you, Schlatt.”",
	"“You’re fucked up, man. Why did me hitting you make you love me?”\n\n“It didn’t- it was just- it made me realise.”",
	"“I just- you hurt me, and it felt… it felt like love. It felt- It felt right. It felt divine.”",
	"It felt like god. Do you know what I mean?” Wilbur moved forward, on his knees with his hands out in the mockery of a prayer.",
	"“Okay, okay. Since the beach, I’ve been in the dark. I’ve been in- in this dark, dark abandoned house. When I saw you earlier, you turned on a light. And- And I could see the colors of the wallpaper! I could see the texture of the armchairs, the golden grains of the wooden table.",
	"“But then you hit me”, Wilbur took a shaky breath, his eyes wide, “and I could see the people. I could see humanity within the house again. Everyone’s souls came back, everyone’s bodies. I could feel the warmth of blood rushing through everyone’s veins again. The warmth of life.”",
	"Of course Wilbur had to be a fucking poet about being touch-starved.",
	"“I… I know what you mean.”\nHe sat beside him, sighing.\n“I know what you mean. I wish I didn’t.”",
	"“You have to get your act together, Wilbur. Don’t make me hate you.”\nHe took a breath and let it out.\n“Loving you is already painful enough.”",
	"“I-I’m sorry”, he whispered, more a prayer than an apology.",
	"“I never want you to go through this alone. Ever again. Next time you feel this way, I want you to come to me. Any time, night or day. Even if I’m at work, or I’m asleep, or I’m at a wedding, or a funeral, I always want you to come to me",
	"“I-I don’t wanna be a burden to you”, he mumbled, his voice cracking.\n\n“Techno, you will never, ever be a burden to me. Okay? I love you. You’re my world, Techno. You’re my soul.”",
	"“I love you, Techno.”\n\n“I love you too, dad.”",

	"Wilbur had never been religious. No, that was a lie. He had been raised Christian. He didn’t remember what branch now, he had been too young",
	"He wasn’t Christian, he knew that much. He believed in God, though. He believed in angels. He didn’t believe in Jesus, but he did believe in hell.",
	"He had ideas about God. Ideas that God was a compass rose, eight points. Eight on its side was infinity, and God was infinity. God was love, and hatred, and suffering, and kindness.",
	"Wilbur knew that he was an angel. He never brought it up, never spoke it aloud, but in the basement of a church surrounded by others, he knew he was different. He knew he was closer to God than any of them.",
	"He knew that he felt the wrath of God in its holy fire within him.",
	"They sat in a circle, going down the way and introducing themselves and explaining why they were there. It was his first meeting. It tasted like cigarette ash on his tongue.",
	"“Uh… my name is Wilbur Soot Watson. I’m eighteen, I’m… I’m a trans guy.” He spoke through gritted teeth and a lump in his throat.",
	"He felt the wrath of God burning in his veins.",
	"There were crucifixes on every wall. Some wooden, silver, et cetera. The one that caught his eye was golden. Thin, with the little pointy things on each of the four ends. He could feel the blind eyes of God watching him through it.",
	"“I don’t care if you shout at me. I don’t care if you cuss me out, okay? But you will not take that inside the house. You will not aim that at your brothers. Do you understand?”",
	"“You’re hurting people, you have to change!” Phil shouted.\n\nWilbur stared at him, tears stinging his eyes. “I-I’m not trying to hurt people.”\n\nPhil sighed. “I know, Wilbur. I know.”",
	"He felt the impact before he saw Techno swing.",
	"“Ow, fucking hell, Techno!” Wilbur cried, holding his cheek. It was already bruised from where Schlatt had hit him, and the pain coursed through his veins like gold.",
	"“Well, I said that Techno almost killed him because he gave him the drugs, and then Wilbur said he had manipulated him into giving him the drugs because he was gonna tell you he was cutting his skin.” Tommy helpfully filled in, earning two glares from his brothers.",
	"“People… people get mean when it’s too dark.”\n\nTommy stared up at him. “Why?”\n\n“Why what?”\n\n“Why do people get mean when it’s dark?”",
	"“The dark is scary. It’s from when we were prey animals. We can’t see through the dark, so we reach out with our hands. Sometimes we panic, and we get desperate, and we hurt people. It’s not intentional. It’s a way of asking for help.”",
	"“It helps. It feels good, like, a release. Like I have all this bad stuff inside me, and- and it gets it out.”",
	"“I get what you mean. Like, pain feels good sometimes.”",
	"“You shouldn’t associate pain with good feelin’s. That’s a bad way to think.”",
	"“Who is it?”\n\n“Your favorite drama queen!” Wilbur called.",
	"“Thanks, Schlatt. Love you.” He said as he stood up.\n\n“Don’t say that shit.”\n\n“Mkay, bye, princess.”",
	"“I don’t want him to start cutting.”\n\n“He won’t.”\n\n“How do you know?”\n\n“He just won’t.”\n\n“You don’t have any evidence.”\n\nWilbur sighed. “All of us can’t be fucked, man.”\n\nTechno quieted and stared at the city lights far below them. “It wouldn’t surprise me.”",

	"It felt nostalgic, being back, but it came with a sense of impending doom. He would be out of highschool soon. What the hell was he going to do?",
	"“I don’t know who you are. I don’t care for you. I run this group, okay? I’m Schlatt’s right hand man. You don’t mean anything to him.”",
	"“Are you so possessive that me having another friend would fuck you up?” Schlatt asked.\n\n“I just don’t want to lose you again”, he mumbled.\n\n“You’re not gonna lose me, Wil. You’d have to move back to England just to get a head start.”",
	"Schlatt thought the touch felt like the petal of a rose.",
	"“I’m still mad at him for breaking my nose. Do you know how perfect my face was, Schlatt?”\n“You’re a narcissist to hell and back, Wilbur.”",
	"Wilbur stifled a laugh. “What are you wearing, dude?”\n\nTechno’s fists balled at his side. “It’s punk.” He was wearing ripped black jeans, his binder and a cut up Ezra Furman shirt. He was also wearing a pair of Wilbur’s black docs, heavy black eyeliner, and a spiked choker.",
	"“Oh my god, please no, I can’t listen to Crywank, dude.” Schlatt complained, throwing his head against the headrest.\n\n“I second that, Crywank sucks. If you’re gonna play something depressing, play Radiohead.” Techno chimed in.",
	"Techno swung high, euphoria shooting through him at the feeling of cartilage cracking under his fist.",
	"“You’re a bunch of fucking psychos!” He called as he left.\n\n“The best you’ll ever meet!”",
	"“Crash the car.”\n\n“I’m not gonna crash the car, Wilbur”, Schlatt sighed.\n\n“Do it. Kill us. Kill us in a bloody, bloody car accident. We’ll all die together. It’ll be poetic.”",
	"“Shut up, Wilbur!” Schlatt growled.\n\n“Or what?! You’ll hit me?! You’ll point your stupid fuckin’ gun at me?! I don’ care, Schlatt!” He laughed, his tone high and manic. “Shoot me! I don’ care! I’m better off dead, everyone knows it!”",
	"“You know what?! I’ll do it myself!” Wilbur undid his seatbelt and opened the car door, jumping out before he could process the reality of what he was doing.",

	"“You have to keep goin’. I know it’s scary. I know he hurt you, he made you feel like you would never be safe again. I promise you’re safe. I promise I will always keep you safe.”",
	"“You can’t just jump out of a car on the freeway!”",
	"There was an empty pool in the back, dozens of beer cans and other alcohol bottles at the bottom of the basin.",
	"“I… I love him, but I’m not in love with him.”",
	"“What is with Watson boys and asking me if I’m gay?”",
	"“I don’t know if I’m gay, because I spent up until basically last year thinking I’d burn in Hell for it. And that’s a scary fuckin’ thought, right? That if I was attracted to guys, I would spend the rest of eternity burning alive? It terrified me. It still does.”",
	"“I owe him this. He raised me, he did his best, the least I can do for him is keep my head down and make him proud.”",
	"“You’re a good kid, Technoblade.”\n\nTechno took the can and tossed his empty one into the pool. “Thanks. You’re a good adult.”\n\nSchlatt laughed at that.",
	"Wilbur looked over at his brother, brown eyes meeting brown eyes. Dark circles under both pairs, brown curls falling over one and pink strand the other.",

	"His lips were chapped. His lips were always chapped, but sometimes it bothered him more than others.",
	"\\[The pool\\] was empty, it had been drained years ago. Empty cans and liquor bottles sat in the basin.",
	"“Parties were never really your thing, huh?”",
	"“How’s Tommy doin’?”\n\nTechno shrugged. “Fuck if I know. Kid doesn’t talk to me.”\n\n“Really? Why not?”\n\n“I dunno. I think he thinks I’m like Wilbur.”",
	"“You’re not as bad as him, Technoblade.”",
	"It was a piece of garbage, a barely functioning 2003 Toyota Avalon. Nothing compared to Wilbur’s Civic, or the Prius that was promised to Tommy for when he would start to drive. But he had bought it himself, no help from his dad. It was important to him.",
	"He was always careful when he was driving. Too often, he would think of getting distracted and driving right into another car, or a pole, or off one of the bridges of the freeway. His mind would be engulfed with images of him dead in his car, shattered glass goring his face.", 
	"It was already ten at night when he got home, so he just let himself in and went upstairs to his bedroom. It was grey, all the furniture black. Pink LEDs lit up the room, soft light in the midst of the fog.",
	"Summer had gone quickly. Wilbur had been home from college and he spent almost every day off with his new friends, and Tommy had secluded himself to his room and Tubbo’s house. Techno had been on his own.",
	"It was a lonely summer, all in all.",
	"His thoughts travelled to Dream, to Dream’s wavy dirty blonde hair and his calloused, freckled hands.",
	"He sighed, a forlorn breath, as he thought of the night he’d spent on Dream’s roof years ago. The way Dream had looked at him, the gaze of a burning star to the dark matter of space. The way he had felt seen for the first time in his life.",
	"Childhood friendships never lasted, he supposed. It didn’t stop him from dreaming about that night on the roof, though.",
	"In the night, he could see the sun in Dream’s eyes, feel the fire in his heart. Sometimes it would swallow him whole, and he would feel safe in the inferno of his friend.",
	"His body ached, he knew a single warm touch would make him collapse. Techno could feel his heart reaching out for anyone, anything to fill his emptiness.",
	"He laid down on his bed, staring at the popcorn ceiling. He could see patterns if he unfocused his eyes. As he felt his body sink with the high, he watched the ceiling morph into familiar shapes. He chuckled, as he realised he could see the outline of minecraft blocks.",
	"He fell asleep with a feeling of falling, the world swirling around him as he plummeted down the rabbit hole.",
	"“So does anyone else have Mr. Smith for English first period?” Fundy asked, taking an obnoxiously long hit from his puff bar. Techno knew it was sour apple-flavored, it was always sour apple-flavored with Fundy. He couldn’t stand it.",
	"“Are you any good at math?”\n\n“Nope. You?”\n\n“Nope. This’ll be fun.”",
	"“Hey, so, are you a girl or a boy?” The guy asked.\n\nTechno bristled. “I’m a guy.”\n\n“Really? Why is your hair pink?”\n\n“I like it that way.”\n\n“You look like a girl.”\n\n“I’m not. Get away from my locker.”",
	"He might as well have been sitting alone at lunch, the way Skeppy and Bad were acting.",
	"“What’re you doing?” Techno asked, standing behind them. The kid looked up at him with wide eyes.\n\n“Mind your business, f*****.” The guy spat.\n\nTechno stared for a moment, then he felt his fist swing into the guy’s face. He stumbled back, clutching his eye and hyperventilating.",
	"Techno stared down at him. It would be so easy to bash his brains in right here and now, to grab his knife and rip his stomach open, pull out his organs and watch him writhe.",
	"“What’s with the mask?” He asked, looking at the half-white half-black cloth on his face.\n\n“Uh, I uh, don’t really like germs.”",
	"“What’s your name?”\n\n“Ranboo.”\n\n“Ranboo? That’s a weird name.”\n\n“What’s yours?”\n\n“Technoblade.”\n\n“Well I don’t think you have room to talk about weird names”",

	"The first thing he felt was a slow sinking. Like the drop off a diving board, slowed to a painstaking pace. The next thing he felt was something wet sliding up his limbs, thin tendrils of blood that climbed him like vines.",
	"Techno pulled out his English folder- which was blue, of course, because English is blue- and took the essay out.",
	"“Techno, I can feel you, man”, Karl whispered, his hands intertwined with Techno’s.\n\n“Uh-huh. I can feel you too, bud.” Techno laughed a little.\n\n“No, I mean… I can feel your soul. It’s burning.”",
	"“What?”\n\n“Your soul, it’s… it’s burning, and- and writhing around like it’s in pain. It’s scared. Are you scared, Techno?”",
	"“You’re just this big… bundle of hate, a-and fear. That’s what your soul is. It’s crying to me, Techno. I can feel it crying.”",
	"“Not at all. Here, just to prove I won’t hurt you or anything, you can hold onto my knife until we get to your house.” Techno pulled his switchblade out of his jean’s pocket and handed it to Ranboo.",
	"“Wait, how do you know Wilbur?”\n\n“He’s the brother I was talkin’ about. You know him?”\n\n“I know of him. Niki talks about him a lot.”\n\n“Really? What’s she say?”\n\n“Uh, just stuff like being worried about him. Missing him, too.”",
	"He was frustratingly bored, and that boredom came with a need to scream. He needed to do something, anything. He had stopped cutting years ago, but his body was screaming for a rush of pain.",
	"dre: Hey Hey hey hey hey\n\nTechno stared at it. Dream obviously wasn’t sober, he never texted him when he was sober anymore.",
	"Techno stared at it for a moment. He could smell it on the other’s breaths now. Smirnoff and cigarettes smoked out the window. It smelled just like Wilbur.",
	"“Christ, you’re obviously fucking jealous, Techno! You’re just jealous b’cause you don’ have any friends, and I have friends, and Tommy doesn’t like you, but my sister likes me! You’re always jealous of me, Techno! You always have been!”",
	"“You’re jealous! You’re jealous because I have a real dad!”",
	"It took him a bit too long to realise it was real.",

	"As he stared at Dream’s bloodied face, George worrying at his side, it started to sink in that he had done that. He stood in shock, held back by Sapnap alone.\n\n“Wait”, he panted, his hearing starting to come into focus, “I didn’t- I didn’t mean to- I didn’t mean to do that”",
	"“I didn’t… I didn’t mean to do that, I thought it was just- I didn’t- I didn’t even feel it.”",	"The road was empty. It was dark, silent as he moved through the world. He needed to pick Tommy up. He had blood on his hands. He needed to turn left here. He could still feel Dream’s nose breaking under his knuckles. Turn signal, Techno. Turn signal, then turn. Dream’s screams played on loop in his head.",
	"He sat in the driveway, staring dead ahead. The scent of copper flooded his lungs. He took a shaky breath, then another. Was that real? Had that happened? He looked at his hands. They were stained red and sticky. He was getting blood on his steering wheel.",
	"When they got home, Tommy ran inside the house. Techno sat in his car for a moment longer, staring at the blood on his hands. In the orange light of the streetlights, it looked like oil, black and slick.",
	"“Christ, Techno. What if they press charges?”\n\nTechno stared at his father. “I didn’t mean to.”\n\n“What good does that do, Techno? You still did it!”",
	"His room was pink. He didn’t want to see anything, so he turned off the lights. His room was black.",
	"He laid down on the bed and stared into the darkness, focusing on his breathing. It was a ragged, shaking animal. As he stared into the darkness, all he could see was blood.",
	"Techno felt his brain fill with static, sharp and black digging into him like glass. He felt himself sink, felt himself fall, felt himself plummet into the darkness of space.\n\n“Techno?” Phil’s voice brought him back to his room.",
	"Phil entered his room, shedding warm light from the hallway and banishing the darkness.",
	"“I don’t wanna go back to therapy”, he mumbled.\n\n“This isn’t optional. You don’t get to beat up your best friend and keep going without changing anything.”",
	"He squeezed his eyes shut, trying to force the images that were already surfacing out of his mind. “I d-didn’t mean to.”\n\n“All the more reason to go to therapy.”",
	"“The thoughts will never go away”, Wilbur had said. “You just have to keep living with them. The important part is that you don’t act on them. No matter how… no matter how powerful it makes you feel.”\n\n“I don’t want to feel powerful”",
	"He chain-smoked. Techno was never one to chain-smoke. It reminded him too much of Wilbur, but he could hardly breathe without the burn in his lungs.",
	"He knew it was getting worse when he found himself in the bathroom in second period, staring into the mirror and imagining his own face bloody and broken.\n\nHe realised he needed to reach out to someone when he punched the mirror, shattering it and staring at the shards.",
	"“Okay. I’ll see ya around.” He said, then turned and left.\n\n“No you won’t!” Bad shouted after him.",
	"Techno paused. The only person Schlatt had ever given free stuff to was Wilbur. It made his stomach twist a little, but he wasn’t about to turn down free alcohol.",
	"He walked along the street, the orange light only serving to make everything feel less real than it already did.",
	"He was starting to understand the appeal of drinking. He’d never gotten drunk, not this drunk at least. The world swayed and buckled under his boots, he had to lean against the street lamps to stay upright every so often.",
	"It was pathetic, wasn’t it? He was sitting under a streetlight a block from his house, chain-smoking and drinking straight from a bottle of Jack. He really was just like Wilbur. Maybe worse, actually. Wilbur never broke anyone’s nose. He’d broken three.",
	"No, he didn’t want to be like Wilbur. If he was going to self destruct, he’d put his own Technoblade spin on it.",
	"He arrived at the park, and stumbled down the rocks at the far end to get to the storm drain that sat at the back of the park. It was one of his favorite places as of late. Easy to reach, private. A good place to smoke.\n\nA better place to die, maybe.",
	"It was a square tunnel, the ground underfoot was wet and covered with leaves. The walls sported hundreds of tags and drawings, all spray paint and sharpie on grey painted concrete. He used the flashlight on his phone to get to the middle, where it was darkest.",
	"He got a sudden impulse to call Wilbur.\n\nNo, he didn’t need to. If he wanted to die alone, he would do it.\n\nHe got a stronger impulse to call Dream.",
	"He missed Dream more than anything. Dream was his home for years, and that had been taken away from him by George and Sapnap. And now he’d burned the bridge permanently.",
	"Everything had been ripped away from him with one stupid mistake. One crack in his mental fortitude.",
	"He took another desperate drink from the bottle and finished his cig, putting it out on his leg. It burned, and he cried out at the feeling, but it made him feel alive for the moment.",
	"“Can you just- God, I’m gonna be so embarrassed about this later. Can you just- just tell me not to kill myself?”",

	"“You can love someone and hate them at the same time. Most people do.”",
	"He could tell something was off. Of course he could, he’d known Techno since he was ten.",
	"Schlatt sighed and sipped his own coffee. It was black. He always made it black, he always hated it, but he would never dare admit that.",
	"“I don’t want you doin’ this stuff, man. You’re actin’ like Wilbur.” Schlatt said, biting his lip out of nerves.\n\nTechno flinched at the accusation. “I-I’m not like Wilbur.”\n\n“I didn’t say you are. I said you’re actin’ like him.”",
	"“You cannot kill yourself. Phil, and Wilbur, and Tommy- they all love you too much. They would never be the same. It would break Tommy, he already had to see Wilbur almost die. He couldn’t take it if you actually did. Do you get that? He’s an impressionable kid, Technoblade.”",
	"That guy has worked his whole life to make you guys happy! Imagine if that got taken away from him, Technoblade. He’d be empty. He’d never feel love again, dude.”",
	"“Fuck, Technoblade, of course they care that much! I care that much!”",
	"“Are you cryin’?”\n\nSchlatt scowled and wiped his eyes. “No I’m fuckin’ not. I don’t cry, moron.” He flicked’s Techno’s forehead, but there wasn’t a drop of malice in his body.",
	"“It just wasn’t enough for you, was it?! You couldn’t just ruin my life, you had to go and fuck up my brother’s too?!”\n\n“I didn’t ruin your life, you fuckin’ moron, you did that yourself! Did I enable you? Sure!”",
	"“You have to talk to Phil about this”, Wilbur said.\n\n“No, I don’t. You never did, why do I have to?” Techno scowled.\n\n“I was never actively suicidal!” Wilbur insisted.\n\n“Yes, you were! You jumped out of a movin’ fuckin’ vehicle, Wilbur!”",
	"“Sure, solve everythin’ with drugs, that’s a good idea.” Schlatt scoffed, leaning- no, falling- against the wall of the kitchen and taking a swig from his flask.\n\n“Prescriptions aren’t drugs, Schlatt!” Wilbur growled.\n\n“Then why’d ya overdose on ‘em?” Schlatt snickered.",
	"“Oh fuck off, you’re drunk”, Wilbur spat.\n\n“Well, you’re high.” Schlatt retorted with a sloppy grin.",
	"“His pupils are dilated, his hands are shakin’ and he’s wiped ‘is nose seven times since he got ‘ere. He’s doin’ blow.” Schlatt said, grin wide as the Cheshire Cat.",
	"“You’re doin’ fuckin’ cocaine?!” Techno yelled, white panic running through his veins.\n\n“My little brother is suicidal, i-it’s a little fucking stressful, okay?! I’m allowed to cope how I want to!”",
	"“Like Schlatt? Like Schlatt? You fuckin’ idiot, I’m takin’ after you! You gave me my first cigarette! You took me to the bar where I had my first drink! It’s all you, Wilbur! It’s always been fuckin’ you!”",
	"Techno glared back, panting, fists balled at his sides.\n“It’s always been you.”",

	"“So the story is, you were alone in your room, sober, and you were just really upset. So you called me and I came down to visit.” Wilbur said, his voice a soft rasp.\n\n“Yeah, and you showed up sober too.”",
	"The world was cast in pale blue light, barely bringing color from the dark blacks and greys of night. Techno’s hair looked a pale purple silver in the early light, Wilbur’s a stark black.",
	"“He’s a bad influence”, he said.\n\n“No shit, he’s a drug dealer. That doesn’t mean he’s a bad person, though. You know that.” Techno paused. “You used to know that, at least.”",
	"If that’s really the case, why are you still doin’ it? Why have you-“ Techno gritted his teeth, his fists balling momentarily. “Why have you moved to harder stuff? If it was really Schlatt’s fault, and not yours, wouldn’t you be sober by now? Clean?”",
	"Wilbur felt his heart twist again. It was agonising, the way he could still feel it despite the miles of waves and thunderstorms that sat on top of it.",
	"“None of this is anyone’s fault but our own, Wilbur. You need to understand that.”",
	"Distantly, he was aware he had almost killed himself that night. And now, a few hours later, he was comforting his fuck-up of a brother because he had the remarkable ability to make everything about him.",
	"He had almost killed himself, and Wilbur was the one crying into his coffee cup like he was the worst off person in the world.",
	"“Hi, dad. I just came down beca-“\n\n“Wilbur is doing cocaine and I almost killed myself.” Techno deadpanned, looking his father in the eye.\n\nThere was a beat of silence.\n\n“What the fuck, Techno?!”",
	"“No one is talkin’ to me at school. Skeppy and Bad are ignorin’ me, and Dream and his friends are yellin’ at me every time they see me. I don’ have any friends left.”",
	"Yeah”, Wilbur mumbled. He swallowed his nerves. “I… I got it from a guy at college. I had done it just before he called.”\n\nPhil stared at him. “Wilbur”, he sighed. “Your campus is two hours from here. A cocaine high only lasts thirty minutes. Please don’t lie to me.”",
	"“How do you know that?” Techno asked.\n\nPhil looked at him with an expression that said, ‘please don’t ask me that’. Or maybe, ‘you already know how’.",
	"“You did cocaine in my house?” Phil asked, his tone breaking on betrayal.\n\nTechno eyed Wilbur cautiously. He was going to tell him they were at Schlatt’s. He was going to lose everything.\n\n“The driveway, if that makes it any better?”",
	"“What do I… what am I supposed to do?” His voice leaked exhaustion, dread and hopelessness.\n\nThe two brothers stared at their father, shocked to see him so… broken.\n\n“What am I supposed to do?” Phil asked again, his words cracking on a sob.",
	"In the end, Phil asked Wilbur to check into rehab. He didn’t force him to, though. His son was twenty years old, he was adult, what power did he hold over him?",
	"“Because that’s the difference between you and I, isn’t it, Techno? I would never betray you like that, and you know it. You don’t hold the same respect for me.”",
	"With that, Wilbur got in the car and pulled out of the driveway. Techno watched him go.\nHe didn’t look back once.",
	"“I don’t wanna think about this”, he mumbled. “Could we just get high?”",
	"“My bosses. They’re fuckin’ scary.” Schlatt huffed a laugh.\n\n“Your bosses? I thought you were like, your own boss?” Techno asked.\n\nSchlatt laughed. “What, you think I just spawned with drugs?”",
	"He turned the bong around to Techno and handed him his lighter. It was a zippo, silver and gold with an engraving on it.\n\n“God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,\ncourage to change the things I can,\nand wisdom to know the difference.”",
	"The two laid on Schlatt’s bed, staring at the popcorn ceiling.\n\n“Do you ever see shit in the… in the little asbestos things?” Schlatt asked, looking over at Techno.\n\nTechno huffed a laugh. “I was just thinkin’ about that. Yeah, all the time.”",
	"“I always see Wilbur”, Schlatt said, his voice a cracking whisper.\n“I always see Wilbur.”",

	"He hadn’t expected the day to be good, but he hadn’t expected it would be this bad.",
	"“Would you have killed him if George and Sapnap didn’t stop you?”",
	"The man nodded. “You like the feeling it gives you? Like you’re free? No pain in the world?”\n\nTechno saw Schlatt’s eyes dart to his, an expression that reiterated, ‘Do not. Take. Anything.’\n“Um, yeah, I guess.”\n\n“You wanna try somethin’ better?”",
	"It hit him almost instantaneously. He felt a wave of peace wash over him, and felt a smile creep onto his face. It held the same slight disorientation as weed, but it felt so much better. He felt happy, he realised. He felt happy for the first time in fucking years. He grinned.",
	"Techno looked at Schlatt, who looked devastated. It reminded him of how Phil had looked when he told him Wilbur was doing coke. But why did he look so upset? Techno was happy. He was happy for the first time in years. Schlatt didn’t want him to be happy?",
	"The guy was right, it was better than weed, it felt amazing. It felt like he’d finally been offered a chance at happiness.",
	"“Why’re you freakin’ out? It feels so good, Schlatt. It feels so good.”\n\n“No fucking shit it feels good, Technoblade, it’s fucking heroin!”",
	"“I don’t want you to do fucking heroin, you idiot! There are other ways to be happy!”",
	"“Please just listen to me, Technoblade. Heroin is like, the worst drug out there. I can’t let you do that.”",
	"That night, laying alone in his bed, he watched the popcorn ceiling as he smoked the new cart. He saw Dream. He saw Wilbur. He saw Schlatt.\n\nHe turned off the light.\n\nHe didn’t see anything.",

	"There were other ways to be happy.\n\n\nTechnoblade wrote a list in the notes app of his phone of things that made him happy.",
	"-Dream\n\n-Skeppy (and bad)\n\n-minecraft (hypixel)\n\n-mashed potatoes (and baked potatoes)\n\n-music\n\n-monster energy (pink and white)\n\n-weed\n\n-\n\nHe stared for a moment more. Typed out, “heroi”, then erased it. That was going against the point.",
	"He slipped his headphones into his ears and put on an album Bad had recommended to him. Sock-Footed, by Teddy Hyde.",
	"He was high, playing Minecraft, listening to music, eating mashed potatoes, and drinking Monster. It had to work.",
	"“Are you high? Your eyes are all big and shit. You don't have your usual shitty aura about you.”\n\n\n\nTechno hesitated, staring straight ahead as he drove.\n\n“A little bit. Don’t tell Phil?”",
	"Tommy sighed. No matter how much he tried, he knew telling on his brothers was a futile effort at this point. Wilbur was still fucked up. Techno was still fucked up. Nothing ever changed.",
	"Techno’s grip tightened on the steering wheel. He easily envisioned speeding into one of the telephone posts on the side of the road, wrapping his car around it and killing both of them. He took a breath to calm himself down.",
	"“... Are you fucking stupid?” Tommy's head snapped in Techno's direction, lips pulled into a scowl. “I don't want you out of my life. I want your shitty decisions out of my life.”",
	"“Since when do you hang out with Schlatt?” That name gave Tommy a gut-wrenching feeling. The memory of a younger Schlatt pulling a gun on Dream on a beach trip two years ago was forever etched in his mind. Tommy wasn't sure he'd ever seen a real gun up close before that.",
	"“He nearly killed Dream, didn't he?” And then, in a brilliant moment of never thinking before he spoke, “Oh, never mind. That's just something you guys have in common, huh?”",
	"“What the fuck have I ever done to hurt you, Tommy?” He finally met his brother’s eyes.\n\n“Have I ever seriously wronged you, outside of trying to deal with my own shit? Is there any legitimate reason you feel the need to talk to me like I’m the worst piece of shit in the world?”",
	"“Are you not scared of me? Is that the problem? ‘Cause everyone fuckin’ else is! Have you not gotten the memo or some shit? I’m Technoblade, I’m a-an inherently evil, p-piece of shit, I’m violent, if you get on my bad side, I’ll b-break your nose!”",
	"“Do I-I need to break your nose, Tommy?”",
	"Tommy scolded himself mentally. He had made so many poor choices tonight. Going to Tubbo's house was a stupid decision. Calling Technoblade to pick him up was a stupid decision. Saying what he had just said was maybe his stupidest decision of the night.",
	"Part of him wanted to plead for mercy, maybe just hop out of the car. Run. Fawn. Flee.\n\n\n\nBut a prouder part of him wasn't done digging his hole.",
	"“Why do you want to break my nose? Why do you want to break me!?” Despite his wishes, Tommy felt his vision growing blurry with tears; but he continued, trying to keep his voice level. “Break Wilbur, break Dream, break Skeppy, break dad? Break everything?”",
	"“I didn’t break dad! Wilbur did, you know I didn’t ever hurt him!”\n\n\n\nWhat? Are you fucking--Techno! You're doing heroin! That's gonna break dad! Wilbur fucked up, a lot, but so have you! Why are you pinning all this shit on him? He doesn't even live here anymore!",
	"“I’m not gonna fuckin’ break dad, stop sayin’ that!”",
	"“I’m fuckin’ responsible, Tommy! I keep my smoking to myself, I keep my drinking to myself, I keep what little drugs I do to myself! I don’t fuckin’ involve you and dad like Wilbur does! It’s my business and mine alone!”",
	"“'Your business and yours alone,' huh? That's why you're dumping all your business on your little brother during a car ride while he's trying to make pleasant conversation, and get pissed when he's reasonably concerned? Upset?”",
	"“I fucked up the best thing I had going for myself... I just want to go home.”",
	"“You probably need a therapist, Tommy. You are, y’know, a brother of Wilbur. I’m pretty sure you’re supposed to go to a therapist after you find your brother overdosed on the floor.”",
	"“You make a good point. Consider, however: it's been a while since that happened, and I'm not as bad off as lots of people I know. I think it'd just be a waste of time.”",
	"“Tommy.” He sighed. “You don’t need to dig your heels in about goin’ to therapy. Do you… do you not wanna be broken? Is that it? You don’t wanna be fucked up, like me and Wilbur, and if you went to therapy that would classify you as such?”",
	"“I really don't want somebody in my head, Tech. That sounds so scary.”",
	"“It is scary, but you have to do it or your life just keeps gettin’ worse.”",
	"“Would you at least talk to a psych, see if you should get medicated?”\n\n\n\n“What? No. Then we'll all be on drugs. We can't all three of us be doing drugs,”",
	"“Dude, what? Medications aren’t drugs. Drugs, like, make the chemicals in your brain go crazy. Medications fix the chemicals in your brain that need fixin’.”",
	"“Point is, I don't want someone poking at my brain, I don't want no drugs messing with things in there either- can we please just leave my brain alone?”",
	"Tommy actually wanted to hang out with him. For the first time in… three years?",
	"If you can get drunk, I can have this,” he rolled his eyes and went right back to biting his nails.",

	"TechnoBlade Never Dies: Does dad drink\nTechnoBlade Never Dies: Alcohol\nTechnoBlade Never Dies: Does he drink alcohol\n\nwilbur: not anymore he’s a recovered alc\nwilbur: why do you ask\n\nTechnoBlade Never Dies: He just came home drunk",
	"TommyInnit: if he starts drinking regularly im never forgiving any of you",
	"“Dude, I didn’t know you’re an artist, what the heck?”\n\n“Your dad taught me”",
	"“It’s, uh, David with the head of Goliath. It’s a Caravaggio.” Techno said, showing Schlatt the reference on his phone.\n\nSchlatt chuckled. “Imagine your name having ‘vag’ in it. What a loser.”",
	"“Yeah, I know. It sucks. It gets better, though. Or, it does in theory. I haven’t really… seen that happen yet.”",
	"“I hope you guys can become friends again.”\n\nFor some reason, those words made Techno’s heart twist. The thought of being friends with Dream again. He took a shaky breath and bit back tears. “Yeah. Yeah, me too.”",

	"He felt calm like this, when he knew he was actually alone. No one around to irritate him, just the telephone wires and the stars to keep him company.",
	"Techno choked back a sob, frustration boiling over and making him want to scream. He pulled at his hair, teeth gritted, and tried to make it stop. A sob ripped out of his throat and he clapped a hand over his mouth to muffle it. Why the fuck was everything so loud? So painful?",
	"Techno felt his guts squirm with fury. “I’m more of a man than you ever fuckin’ could be, moron.”",
	"He realised there was blood on his knuckles again. His stare shifted to them, the dark, glistening liquid staining his hands red. He felt a sick pride rise in him, and his face split into a grin.\n\n“If you wish to defeat me, train for another hundred years”",
	"“You’re a f-fucking psycho”, the guy coughed.\n\n“Oh, I’m the best you’ll ever meet.”",
	"He hadn’t even realised what he was doing was wrong when he was doing it, it… it felt perfect. Divine.",
	"“What is wrong with you?” Phil asked. Techno felt sick at the words- it wasn’t rhetorical. His father was genuinely asking what was wrong with him.",
	"His words came out with desperation, barely a stone’s throw from crying. “You traumatised Wilbur! You nearly got us sued by Dream’s family! You fucking got yourself expelled, Technoblade!”",
	"“When is it going to stop, Techno?! When you actually get sued?! When you actually fucking kill someone?!”",
	"“Technoblade”, Schlatt whispered, his eyes wild. “Leave my house or I will shoot you.”\n\nTechno froze, his eyes darting up to the gun pressed against his head, to the eyes of the man with his life in his hands. He let out a shaky breath.\n“You won’t do it.”",
	"“You won’t kill me.”\n\n“I will.”\n\n“Do it, then.” Techno hissed.\n\nSchlatt stared at him. “Leave my house.”\n\n“Shoot me.”\n\nA moment passed, their eyes locked, before Techno heard the safety click back on. He grinned. “Knew it.”",
	"“Pleasure doin’ business with you.” Techno grinned and offered a half-wave before leaving through the front door.\n\nSchlatt felt sick.",

	"He hissed through his teeth as the cold water slammed against his thighs, the sting hitting him with a familiar sensation. He hadn’t cut in years, but the feeling made him shudder in delight.",
	"He missed it, he realised. The regular, scheduled, intentional pain.",
	"“Do you want the 100 Gecs sweater or the Scary Jokes one?”\n\nTechno huffed a laugh. “I’ll take the 100 Gecs. You’d get along with Ranboo.”",
	"“He’s just- he’s- he’s good, you know?” His free hand flapped a little.\n\n“I know. I was never too close with him, but he seems like a good person.” Techno lied. He didn’t care for Sapnap, but that was neither here nor there.",
	"“You don’t have a real dad?”\n\n“Uh, my brothers and I are all adopted.” Techno muttered.\n\n“Jesus, dude. That’s really… that’s really messed up. Not- Not you being adopted! I’m sorry, I-I meant what he said to you!”",
	"He sat by the gate at the side of the house, watching the driveway as he smoked. He relished in the feeling it gave him, washing away the little things he’d been worried about. Letting out the quiet pains that sat inside him.",
	"He blew the smoke out of his lips, feeling like it had come from inside him since the very beginning. His body was full of smoke, suffocating his every cell, and smoking was just letting it out.",
	"Two little lines, to start. A rolled up dollar bill to snort with and his school ID to sort them into place. A little ironic, he thought.",
	"Tommy wasn't sure how to feel about Technoblade. He was tearing the family apart, leaving an incredible burden on Tommy's shoulders. He wasn't there to protect him anymore. He had hurt so many people in the past.",
	"But he was willing to pull strings to make sure Tommy would be safe still, to fix him up, willing to not bust Tommy's shit himself when the younger had given him so many reasons to. So maybe he was coming around.",
	"“I’m not tryin’ to be a bitch, Tommy. It’s just… y’know, you’re a Watson. We tend to spiral.”",
	"“It's not- it's not a Watson thing. I'm not a-” he cut himself off once he realized what he was about to say. Guilt settled in his bones.\n\nTechno stared at him, eyes broken like a bottle smashed against a wall.\n\n“You’re not a what?”\n\n“Not a... not a bad decision maker?”",
	"His unspoken words bounced around in his mind. “I'm not a Watson.”",

	"“So, what kind of crimes have you committed?”",
	"“You know, you do drugs, you get in fights, do you do anything else? I'm not gonna tell dad, I'm just wondering.”\n\nTechno shook his head. “Tommy, you can’t ask me shit like that. I gotta at least pretend I’m not a bad influence on you.”",
	"“Anyways, sorry for being so nosy all the time. It just feels like we haven't... really talked in years.”\n\nTechno shrugged.\n“We haven’t. Communication isn’t really my forte.”",
	"“Am I, like, a shitty brother?” He asked, his voice strained. “Fuck, I sound like Wilbur.”\n\n“Let's put it this way, I think all three of us are a bit shit in our own rights,” he laughed along with Techno.",
	"“Ohhh. Yeah, it is pretty fucked up, but... hey. Life's a bitch!”",
	"Do you even know your moon and rising?”\n\nTommy sputtered. “You are literally fucking speaking in tongues. Is spirituality the new hip trans rite of passage that I didn't know about?”\n\n“This close to LA? Yeah, dude. It is.”",
	"“My name is Ezekiel, it’s nice to meet you two.” He offered a wide grin.\n\n“It’s nice to meet you too”, Techno responded, his voice smaller than usual. He felt his cheeks burn.",
	"“We're in L.A. I think 75% of the people you meet around here are trans,”",
	"From left to right, there was the Eight of Swords, The Fool, reversed, and The Tower.",
	"“Your habits will become too manic, too wild. It will end up destroying you, Tommy. You and the ones you love.” He met Tommy’s eyes.\n“Your downfall will be influenced by others, but you have the reigns, and you will guide yourself into catastrophe.”",
	"“You control your own life. You have to give yourself your happy ending.",
	"Ezekiel’s expression grew more concerned as Tommy went on.\n\n“Do you want a hug?”",
	"“I’m sorry, Tommy. The world has not been kind to you.”",
	"“I don't want to be like my brothers. God, that's the last fucking thing I want. But I find myself acting more and more like them every day, and I don't know how to help myself.”",
	"“I don't tell people when I'm upset, I drop people if they confront me, and I... run away?” he gave a nervous laugh. “I'll just... leave the house when I shouldn't, won't tell anyone. The funniest part is that no one ever really notices I'm missing, and then boom, I'm back.”",
	"“What are you apologising for?”\n\n“I'm being difficult,”\n\n“You’re being human”",
	"“Techno, I’m an adult.”\n\n“You’re an alcoholic!” Techno shouted, fists balling at his sides.",
	"Phil had raised his hand to hit him.\n\nHe wasn’t safe anymore.\n\nTommy wasn’t safe anymore.",

	"TechnoBlade Never Dies: Yeah. You should take the bus home. Don’t let him drive you please\n\nTommyInnit: really\nTommyInnit: 11 am?\nTommyInnit: im not even mad just disappointed\n\nTommy smiled to himself despite the news. Saying the parent line about the parent was some good irony.",
	"TommyInnit: maybe i make jokes so i can feel better about everything\nTommyInnit: maybe i cry myself to sleep and laugh about it through text so i dont feel worse\nTommyInnit: youre so insensitive to my plights",
	"“Well, I hereby extend my hand in protective friendship, my dear Thomathy.” Dream bowed, ever the drama queen.\n“Let the lord prove you to be a better Watson than the last one.”",
	"He had made so many promises to himself. So many of them he had recently broken. He gave up on his grudge against Techno, gave up on staying with Tubbo through thick and thin, gave up on being the model child in private.\n\nWhat was one more disappointment?",
	"“Hey, you were there, weren't you? On that beach trip after we took him to the hospital?”\n\n“Yeah, I was! Schlatt pulled his fuckin’ Glock on me, dude!” Dream laughed along.\n\n“They were the best of times, they were the worst of times,”",
	"“So what’s going on with you? Wilbur moved off to college and Technoblade got expelled, right? How’re you dealing with all that?”\n\n“Vaping in the cars of people I barely know, apparently,”",
	"“Never become friends with codependent people, Tommy.”\n\n“We aren’t codependent!” George objected.\n\n“You live in his house!”\n\n“Yeah, because my house sucks!”\n\n“You have two stories and a garage fridge, dude!”",
	"“You guys suck, I should’ve ditched you for Karl and Quackity”, Sapnap grumbled. “Hey, would you mind if I invited them, actually?” He asked, perking up a little.\n\n“Yes, I would”",
	"“You good, Tommy?”\n\n“Yeah. Time ain't right, but I am.” He didn't understand the thought process behind his words, logic going all sorts of nonsensical.",
	"Dream chuckled. “I’m glad you can defend yourself. Just know that if he ever tries to hurt you, you can come to me, okay?” He made Tommy meet his eyes.\n“Because he will try to hurt you. It’s only a matter of time.”",
	"“What's it like... having a good brother?”\n\n“Ah”, Sapnap took a deep breath and sighed. “Uh, it’s nice. He’s… yeah, he’s nice. It feels good to have someone in your corner, y’know?”",
	"“Do you feel like you’re a bad person because your brothers are?”\n\n“I feel like I'm turning one,”",
	"“You know that, like, doing drugs and drinking and stuff… it doesn’t make you a bad person. You get that, right?”\n\n“I get that, yeah. But they can change you. And sometimes it's just... for the worse,”",
	"“Do you feel safe at your house? With your dad drinking and Techno… being Techno?”\n\n“Safe enough,” he muttered. “I'm too high to think about this, man, I dunno.”\n\nHe hummed again. “I wouldn’t feel safe.”\n\n“Good thing I'm not you, then.”",

	"“You don’t like the rain, huh?” Techno asked, walking into Ranboo’s house after watching him sprint to the shelter of the porch.",
	"I just wanted to know what the appeal was.”\n\n“I’m sure Wilbur wanted to know the appeal of cocaine, too.”",
	"“Wilbur spent nearly all of the seven years he lived here betraying my trust. He is not moving in here again when he finishes college. He lost that privilege when he did cocaine in my house.”",
	"Techno found his footing in the coarse dirt, Wilbur’s hand on his arm to steady him.\n\n“Careful, you almost fell.”\n\n“Would it really be so bad to fall?”",
	"“Look up at the moon.”\n\nTechnoblade did as he was told.\n\n“She’s a mother, you know. She watches over us.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“She loves us.”\n\n“But she wouldn’t catch us.”",
	"“The waves would catch us.”\n\n“Not kindly.”\n\n“When we fall this far, it’s impossible to be caught with kindness, Techno.”\n\n“The waves wouldn’t let us breathe.”\n\n“No”, Wilbur acknowledged, “not while they held us.”",
	"“Wouldn’t you rather fall on the rocks?”\n\n“I got close, once.”\n\n“I know.”\n\n“Then you know why I aim for the waves.”"

	"“Why would you believe Ranboo and not me?“ Tommy opened up the pantry, eyes desperately searching for something to grab and just go.\n\n“Because he has no reason to lie. You do.”",
	"“I want to be here for you, Tommy. I don’t want you to go through shit without someone on your side, you get that, right? I want you to know you can always trust me to keep you safe.”",
	"“Obsidian check?”\n\nHe blinked, then nodded and dug into the pocket of his sweats.\n“Right here.”",
	"The frustration Tommy felt from the whole interaction melted in a matter of moments. His mind was a confusing place, but suddenly his affections were swayed in Techno's favor. He smiled.\n“Jesus, I can't wait for Wilbur to visit. We'll be, like- the obsidian bros.”",
	"“The guy sold him stuff that was laced with fentanyl, Technoblade. He overdosed. His six year old sister found him.”\n\nHe felt bile rise in his throat, his heart twisting in pain and dread.\n\n“She thought he was sleeping.” Schlatt whispered.",
	"“Do you know what an opioid overdose looks like, Technoblade?” Schlatt asked.\n\nTechno shook his head.\n\n“It just looks like you’re asleep. Sometimes you throw up, sometimes you don’t. If your eyes are closed, they don’t see how small your pupils are.”",
	"“Do you think Tommy would know what to look for? Or do you think he would let you sleep?”",
	"“The hell is your problem, man?”\n\nTechno didn’t even budge. He clicked his jaw to the side, fists balling. “What’s my problem?” He laughed a little.\n“Jesus, man, I dunno. People say I’m a little hot-headed.”",
	"“You know what, Tech?” He brought a hand to his cheek, rubbing the spot. “Some people say the same about me.” With better form than anybody else Techno had gotten into a fist-fight with, Punz swung, mirroring the knock Techno got at his face.",
	"“Okay, no, Punz? We're not doing this,” Purpled stepped between the two, facing his brother. He held his arms wide to act as a barrier.\n\n“He broke my nose! Gimme one reason I shouldn't!”",
	"Techno stared at his popcorn ceiling, eyes half-lidded as he faded in and out of consciousness.\n\nHe couldn’t find a single pattern.",

	"“Wilbur, I don’t want you dead. I care about you, I love you, okay? Can you put the bottle down so you don’t hurt anyone?”",
	"“How do I know you won’t call the cops too?”\n\n“I’m an anarchist, Wilbur. I wouldn’t call the cops if my own life depended on it”",
	"“H-He hates me”, he said, letting Techno fold him into a gentle hug. “He hates me, he said it.”\n\n“I didn’t say I hate you”, Phil whispered, still partially stunned silent.\n\n“You did! You did, Phil! You-“\n\n“I said I hate what you’re becoming!”",
	"“He- he tried to rob us, Techno. He was taking the fine china.”\n\n“I don’t care, Phil, he’s your son!”",
	"“I-I only need a couple hundred dollars”, he insisted.\n\n“Yeah, Wilbur? What do you need it for? Hm?” Phil glared at his eldest son.\n\nHe shifted uncomfortably in his gaze, hot shame burning his shoulders. “I-I only need a couple hundred dollars”, he whispered.\n\n“What for, Wilbur?”",
	"“I miss you”, Wilbur’s voice cracked on a choked back sob.\n\nThe other two looked at him, not having expected the words.\n\n“I always wonder if you’re proud of me.”",
	"“Proud of you? Proud of you, for trying to rob me? Proud of you, for becoming a literal cocaine addict?” Phil scoffed. “You’re not the Wilbur I knew. You’ve fallen off the edge.”",
	"“It’s f-fucking stupid. I really love him, you know? I really- I really think of him as my dad. It j-just…” Wilbur covered his face with his hand, forcing back a cry. “It hurts so much that h-he doesn’t think of me as his son.”",
	"“You’ll always be my brother, Wilbur.”",
	"“I mean it. You mean the world to me, Wilbur. You and Tommy.” Techno said, holding his hand tighter. “You guys are my heart.”",
	"“Wilbur finally visited, huh?” he asked instead.\n\nTechno sighed. “Yeah. I think it was for the last time, though. Phil took his house keys.”\n\nSo, it went well? Tommy smiled into Techno's skin.\n\nHe huffed. “Sure, you could say that.”",
	"He let himself be held closer, reveling in the feeling of affection. He had been so starved of it for what felt like years.",
	"“I… I won’t leave you alone here with him, Tommy. He’d have to fuckin’ kick me out, okay?”",
	"“And uh... thanks for hanging on for me. Yeah.”\n\nHe felt his heart rush at the words, he bit his lip to hold back tears.\n“Thank you givin’ me somethin’ to hang on to”, he whispered.",
	"“That's a good... holy shit I was gonna try and befriend Purpled.” Tommy looked up at Techno, pursing his lips to fight a smile. “Hey, man, so I get that my brother broke your brother’s nose, but I was wondering if you wanted to kick my ass in bedwars later?”",
	"“Look, look! Okay, Tommy, three, two, one!” He started blowing bubbles again, him and Tommy doing it in sync.\n\nTechno and Quackity stared for a moment, before Quackity burst out in laughter. “Is that fucking Megalovania?!”",
	"The rest of the day was a sunflower gently swaying in the breeze.",
	"“I can’t help but feel I took on the role of a daughter in this family because I have the longest hair.”",
	"His tone was awfully defensive, but he was sick of having his good days ruined by little disasters cropping up. Like nausea he couldn't purge.",
	"“Okay. Thank you, Mr. Karl's uncle. So, is Karl gonna be my step-cousin soon, or what's going on here?”\n\nHe did a double-take and blinked. “I- What? No, Phil and I aren’t- we’re not-”",
	"“Farewell, Mr. Karl's uncle.” He had stayed quite deadpan throughout the interaction.\n\nHe wasn't much in the business of trusting the man that always brought Phil home drunk.",
	"“Don’t ever start drinking, Tommy”, he whispered.",
	"Tommy thought about confessing the rum and wine and vodka Dream and his friends had introduced Tommy to. He thought about showing trust to his brother, his brother who gave him so much.",

	"He took a cold bottle of Coke from the shelf and took a moment to ponder why he was so adamant about stealing the snacks. He could pay for them.\n\nGuilty sneakers carried him and his conscience to the counter.",
	"“How about this, if I give you rules that kept me from gettin’ caught will you follow them?”\n\nThis was exactly why Tommy was cocky enough to shoplift on a trip with Techno in the first place. He knew there'd be no real repercussions from his brother if he got caught.",
	"“I can’t help but feel like shoplifting is being… gentrified.”",
	"Tommy felt himself slipping back into that pattern of hating Techno, loving Techno, and then hating him again. Currently, the pendulum was cast on detestation.",
	"If Techno got pissed, he could reason that he was still just joking. He never did know when to let a bit die.",
	"“You really are a Watson, you know.”",
	"“That’s exactly how it starts, Toms. I’d give it a month or two before you become dependent.”\n\nTommy rolled his eyes. “No, I'll be different. I promise.”\n\nWilbur scoffed. “You won’t.”",
	"“Do you really gotta date people to know your sexuality?” Tommy chimed in.\n\n“No, you don’t.” Techno muttered.\n\nWilbur shrugged. “It helps. I guess it would be more difficult for you two since you’re… y’know.”\n\n“The fuck does that mean?”\n\n“You’re not… naturally charming.”",
	"“I had really bad nightmares for a while after... all of that.” He still had bad nightmares, but he didn't want them fussing. He just didn't want to be undermined. “I've gone through my own shit, too. I just don't like talking to you two. You guys are lame,”",
	"“I’m putting my bets on alcohol poisoning or getting hit by a car.”\n\n“Wilbur, what the fuck?” Techno looked at him in disgust.\n\n“I’m joking!”",
	"“Good, good. Fuck. Thank you, Toms. It really, really means a lot.” Wilbur sighed in relief.\n\n“You’re a really good brother, you know that?”",
	"“You’re not a bad person, Tommy. You’re the best of us. You really are.” Wilbur smiled.\n\nTommy's breath caught at Wilbur's words.\nI'm the best of us?\n\nWilbur stared at him for a moment. “Yeah, you are. Of course you are, Toms.”",
	"“You’re the best of us, Tommy. You really are. You’re the only good person we have left.”",
	"“How good can I really be?”\n\n“None of that matters, Tommy. You’re a good person, down to your soul. You don’t hurt people on purpose like we do.”",
	"“Thank fuck. I was so fucking scared I was an awful person.” He wasn't sure how much he trusted Wilbur's opinions in general, but he could hold onto this. This was something he was willing to convince himself of.\n\n“Not even close, Toms. You’re the best of us.”",
	"“I love you Wilbur.” Saying 'I love you' didn't come very easy to Tommy, it always felt too raw, too sentimental, not guarded enough. This moment was all of those things and more, though, removed from anyone who may judge him and placed in front of the brother he missed so dearly",

	"Californian Novembers went like this.",
	"You would sit in your car, listening to Cat, watching the amber mountains pass you by. You would point out a hawk to your brother, he would imitate its call, and you would laugh so hard you had to have him take the wheel for a moment.",
	"You would fall into a comfortable silence with him again, and then he would ask you a question.\n\n“D’you think Wilbur’s a good person?”\n\nYou wouldn’t know what to say to that.",
	"Californian Novembers went like this. Your brother would get out of the car and stretch, popping his elbows and shoulder blades. You would look at him and wonder when he got to be as tall as you. He would head inside, and you would watch the neighbourhood for a moment.",
	"You would wonder when memories of playing at the park were replaced with memories of getting blackout drunk and trying to kill yourself only a few hundred feet from the playground.",
	"You wouldn’t ask your brother what he had been doing in your father’s room. It wouldn’t cross your mind, in all honesty.",
	"Your headphones would push the sound of harsh guitar and singing that sounded like crying into your ears, your pupils would shrink pinpoints behind your eyelids, your nose would start bleeding while you slept, and you wouldn’t notice it until the next morning.",
	"“What if we got caught?”\n\n“Then I kidnapped you and you had no choice.”\n\nRanboo laughed at that. “A little self-sacrificing, isn’t it?”\n\nTechno shrugged. “Nah, I could take the pigs. It’s not sacrifice if you don’t lose.”",
	"“Are your eyes different colors?” Techno asked.\n\nRanboo grimaced. “Uh, no, not technically. I’m just blind in this one.” He pointed to his left eye. “Cataracts.”",
	"“Yeah! That’s gender, baby!”",
	"“I really like that. Thank you for teachin’ me.”\n\n“Thank you for asking.”",

	"Techno heard his father close the door to his bedroom at seven that night, listened carefully enough to hear the cap of a bottle unscrew. It made his heart ache with a sickening mix of worry and fear, made his blood run cold and hot and clench his fists.",
	"A small sniff showed him whiskey, half-empty, sloshing around in his sixteen-year-old brother’s fucking flask.",
	"He felt bitter nostalgia dig at his chest as he knocked on the door of Dream’s house.",
	"The other hesitated, then opened the door wider and led him upstairs to his bedroom. Techno felt the blood in his organs spill at the familiarity of it all. He missed Dream so much it made him wish he was dead.",
	"Tommy betrayed his trust. Maybe he deserved to be sixth.",
	"“He’s sixteen.”\n\n“Didn’t Wilbur start when he was fourteen? What’s the problem? He’s a Watson, isn’t he?”",
	"“Why do you have a flask?! A fucking flask?!” He shouted, tears budding in his eyes. “Do you know a single non-alcoholic that owns a flask?!”",
	"“I never meant to hurt you, Dream. I know you’re n-not evil. I- I didn’t mean to hurt you. I loved you.”",
	"“I didn’t mean to hurt you. I loved you.”\n\nDream took a confident, looming step forward.\n“That’s the problem, isn’t it, Technoblade?” Their faces were barely a foot away. His eyes were wide, sick, and manic.\n“You always hurt the people you love.”",
	"Tommy started shaking his head. He'd rather take a thousand knives to the throat than accompany a brother to the hospital again.",
	"His head cleared enough to have a singular coherent thought: is this a panic attack? Is this a bad trip? Is this Hell?",
	"“Tommy? Could you get him on the other side?”\n\nTommy nodded, sliding under his brother's arm. He thought of the way he watched Techno do this for Phil not that long ago.",
	"“Both o’ you keep it down, okay?” Phil slurred, taking another swig as he headed back to his room.\n\n“Sure thing, Phil.” Techno spat through gritted teeth.\n\nHe paused. Turned around.\n“‘s there a problem, Freja?”",
	"KarlJacobs: Is everything ok?\n\nTommyInnit: not really",
	"“You’re an asshole, Phil.” Techno scowled.\n\n“Oh, Jesus, Techno, what’re y’ gonna do about that?” Phil took a step forward and his son tensed further. “You gonna break my nose?”",
	"Everything was really fucked this time. His nose was broken, Phil was blackout or something close to it, he had confirmation that he and Dream would really never be friends again.",
	"“My car? My car is fine. And her name is Carl, for your information.” Techno grumbled. “I’m very proud of her.”",
	"“Maybe you guys are on level playing ground now?” Tommy suggested. “Broke each other's noses, nearly killed each other... maybe you guys can move on to the talking stage of things now.”\n\nTechno didn’t respond, just cried louder, curled over, pulled his hair, and choked out sobs.",
	"Tommy's pendulum of feelings for Techno had been off-kilter all night, rapidly swinging back and forth. Currently, it was settled on love and wasn't budging.",
	"“I j-just don’t want you to turn out like… like us. You know?”\n\n“I know, Tech. I know,” his knuckles turned white, “I don't, either. But I promise I'll be okay.”",
	"Black waves crashed against the rocks far below the cliff’s edge. Tommy wondered if they would catch him."
