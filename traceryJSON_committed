"“Hey, Tech. Would you mind running to the store to get heavy cream?” Phil asked, looking up from his phone. “I managed to forget it. I’ll give you a ten, get something for yourself too.”",
"\\[Techno’s room\\] was dark and for the most part, monochromatic. Grey sheets with grey pillows, grey blinds and white carpet. The LEDs on his walls were pink, though, which cast a pink light through the whole room. His blinds were shut, and clothes littered the floor.",
"Techno laid down on the bed with a sigh. His popcorn ceilings had patterns if he looked close enough.",
"“Oh, perfect timing. I just finished icing the cake.” Phil smiled, showing it off to Techno. \n\nIt read, “Happy Birthday Tobby”. \n\nTechno snorted. “You spelled Toby wrong.”", 
"He changed into black jeans and a T-shirt with a smiley face on it. It had been a normal T-shirt once, but he had hung out with Dream and his friends a few weeks ago, and now all of them had smiley face T-shirts. It was drawn on with a sharpie. He liked it.",
"“Shit. Fuck. Don’t tell Phil?”", 
"“You’re a natural”, Wilbur joked.\n\n“I think that’s a bad thing.” Techno said, blowing smoke out into the night air.\n\nWilbur was quiet for a moment. “Yeah, probably.”",
"“I mean it makes sense, given today.” Wilbur said, rubbing the side of his arm to warm it up.\n\n“What do you mean?” Techno asked, looking over at Wilbur.\n\nWilbur looked back at him. “What... what do you mean ‘what do you mean’. It’s the day before Christmas.”",
"“You know I… like… care about you, right? You’re my friend. I wanna make sure you’re okay.”",
"“Mhm. Hey, Techno?”\n\nHe paused. “Yeah? What?”\n\n“Sweet dreams. I love you.”", 
		
"Josh L.\n23\nLooking for someone special. 🍃 and booze friendly. Heteroflexible, open to almost anything. Hmu, I talk back :D",
"“You were there last night too. Are you planning on spending the rest of winter break there?” He asked.\n\nWilbur bristled and gritted his teeth, a sudden anger rising in him. “Jesus, I dunno! Maybe? Why do you care?”",
"“God, you’re somehow even more beautiful in person. Come on in, the sushi just got here. Would you like a glass of wine?”\n\nMentally, Wilbur fist pumped. Free alcohol. Always a win. Almost erased the discomfort of the gendered compliment.",
"“Yeah, I’m…” Wilbur trailed off as he felt his body sink backwards into the couch, and his vision started to lag. “Good.”",
"“Aw, come on, I’ve barely seen you recently!” Tommy said, pulling his sleeve.\n\nWilbur froze, then yanked his hand away from his younger brother. “Don’t fucking touch me, Tommy!”",
"He was quiet. He was very, very careful to be quiet. His whole body felt like it was on fire.",

"The world was beginning to sway pleasantly, and Wilbur capped the bottle and returned it to the space under his bed frame. He took a deep breath and pulled out his phone. It was only 10:34 AM. He laughed a little at that, this was definitely the earliest he’d gotten plastered.",
"It felt wrong. That was the closest way he could think to describe it. It felt deeply, terribly wrong.",
"He pulled at his binder a little, making sure it was still in place. It felt comforting to him, like a shield that would keep unwanted touches away. The pressure he had always found annoying felt safe now.",
"It happened in a flash- Tommy tried to hit his hands away, Wilbur’s rage sparked, and the next thing he felt was the palm of his hand stinging his brother’s face.",
"Wilbur screamed, the feeling of hands on him sending fire through his veins. He writhed against his brother’s grip, shrieking and kicking and sobbing profanities.",
"“Why did you hit Tommy?” Techno asked, eyeing Wilbur carefully.\n\n“I’m… ‘m not drunk”, he sniffled, pulling his beanie over his hair.\n\n“Wilbur, I’m gonna be honest, if you hit Tommy while completely sober, I’m gonna break your fuckin’ ribs. You better have an explanation.”",
"“I’m really sorry, Tommy”, he mumbled.\n\nTommy looked at him with a mix of sympathy and cautiousness. “It’s… it’s okay. Just don’t do it again”, he said, taking a shaky breath.\n\nWilbur nodded. “Never.”",
"By the time school started up again a few days later, his brothers had gotten used to an almost permanent state of drunkenness from Wilbur.",
"“I’m not drunk, I’m just tired. Gimme.”\n\n“I can literally see a bottle of vodka in your backpack”",
"“Tommy, get out.” He deadpanned.\n\nTommy shook his head.\n\n“Tommy, get out of the car. This isn’t safe.” Techno ordered.\n\nTommy shook his head again. “If Wilbur wants to die he has to kill me too.”",
"“No! You’re going to get in a car accident and you’re going to die, if you die I want to die too!”",
"“I don’t need you guys to be worried about me! I’m fucking fine, now get out of the car!” Wilbur yelled, glaring at Tommy.\n\n“No! I’m not going to let you kill yourself!” He cried, backing away from Wilbur even further.\n\n“Why not?!” Wilbur shouted.",
"The car was loud, Tommy and Tubbo’s shrieks of laughter bouncing off the walls. A keen eye could tell Tommy was more reserved than usual, and a thin layer of tension surrounded the brothers.",
"He took long swigs, desperately, and took a few deep breaths to let the feeling wash over him. It was okay. He was safe. He didn’t have to think about it if he couldn’t think.",
"“Don’t ever drive drunk again. Even tipsy.” He said, holding out his pinky finger. “For me and Tommy. Please.”\n\nWilbur felt the words sink and weigh down his chest, but he nodded and pinky swore. “I promise”",
"Wilbur sat alone in his room, staring at his phone. The room was dark, his usually minimalist design a wreck of dirty clothes and trash. ",
"He took a deep breath, feeling the pressure of his binder reassure him.\n\nAlone in his room, he could almost forget the feeling of another man’s hands on his chest.\n\nAlmost.",
 
"“Should I be worried about you?” Schlatt asked, glancing up from his phone.\n\n“No”, Wilbur scowled.",
"Schlatt made eye contact with him, then. Wilbur wished he hadn’t. Schlatt was the only person left that he thought wouldn’t judge him. The look on his face proved otherwise.",				
"D&D is today.” Wilbur said, readjusting his beanie.\n\n“Ah, is this the one where you all have countries?” Phil grinned.\n\nWilbur scoffed. “Yeah, well, we used to. Tommy and Techno and I have a refuge, but Schlatt kicked us out.",
"“Tommy, am I a- am I a bad- am I a villain?” Wilbur asked, his voice breaking at the words.\n\nTommy paused, looking at his brother. He hesitated, watching the glint of honesty in Wilbur’s eyes.\n\n“No.”\n\n“Why not?”",
"He looked like he was asking for something like he was asking for forgiveness. Tommy blinked and shook his head, trying to reset his brain. This wasn’t about real life. This was fictional, if Wilbur wanted to have this conversation, he would need to take it seriously.",
"Just like that, the honesty dissipated from Wilbur’s eyes. He was back in character. He slipped back into his role with ease, the break going unnoticed by everyone else at the table.\n\nTommy almost despised him for it.",
"“You’re not a bad guy, Wilbur.” Tommy was the first to speak.\n\nWilbur tensed. He kept his eyes on the road.\n“That was just my character, Toms.”\n\n“Was it?”\n\n“Does it matter?”\n\n“I feel like it does.”\n\n“Well, it doesn’t.”",
"”Just because we’re related by some stupid fucking legal documents doesn’t mean you get to know every little detail of my fucking life, okay? Christ!”",
"He punched his wall until his knuckles were red and bloody. He didn’t even make a dent.",

"Techno hated the silence that followed. Dream was warm, and what had felt comforting seconds ago felt like hot shame now.",
"He always hated silence with Dream. He loved it on his own, but with Dream it came with anger. An anger that settled on his skin like a layer of ash, fallen from a plume of smoke.",
"“It didn’t feel like I was puttin’ smoke in my lungs, it felt like I was lettin’ smoke out for the first time.”",
"“Do you ever get that feelin’? Like there used to be a fire inside you, but now it’s just smouldering away? Fillin’ you up with smoke?",
"Dream watched a plane overhead. Tiny blinking lights, quietly crossing the sky.\n\n“No, the only time I feel the fire inside me is when someone pours in gasoline. Then I feel it through my whole body.”",
"“I think you’re like the sun.”\n\n“One day I’m gonna explode and kill everyone?” Dream teased.\n\nTechno scoffed. “No, you’re… fiery. You’re full of passion. I think you’re so full of emotions it burns you.”",
"“What would that make you?”\n\n“I think that would make me dark matter.”\n\n“Blocking out the stars?”\n\n“Not intentionally. It’s just in my nature”",
"Techno studied his friend’s face. In the dark, illuminated only by the moon, his green eyes looked grey. His freckles looked like stars. Techno wished he could live among those stars.",
"Dream returned the favor. Techno’s face was round like the moon, chubby cheeks and hooded eyelids framing dark brown eyes.",
"“It’s rainin’.” Techno said.\n\n“We should go inside”, Dream said.\n\nThe two did not go inside. Techno rested his forehead on Dream’s, closing his eyes.",
"“Do you believe in it?”\n\n“What, sausages?”\n\nTechno scoffed. “No, like, Christianity.”",
"“I don’t believe in the bible, no. I do believe there’s a god, though.”\n\n“Do you think he’s kind?” Techno asked.\n\nDream didn’t have an answer for that.",
"“Thank you, Techno. I love you.”\n\n“…I love you too, dad.”",
"“Wilbur doesn’t hate you.”\n\n“H-He said that we’re only related because of some papers”, Tommy sobbed, leaning into Techno’s touch.\n\nTechno felt the fire in his body ignite. He gritted his teeth. “Do you want me to beat him up?”\n\n“No, I j-just want him to love me!”",
"As the car drove away, Techno’s expression fell. Then it kept falling, until all that was left was a snarl and a fire behind his eyes.",
"Wilbur struggled against him. “Fucking let me go, you idiot! It’s the truth!”\n\nWith those words, Wilbur poured gasoline on the fire.",
"“Aren’t we your brothers?! How could you say that? He loves you more than he loves himself, and you fuckin’ crushed him!”",
"“You’re a fucking psychopath, Techno. You’re sick.”",
"Techno stood, heavy breaths shaking his body. He wiped his eyes, leaving a smear of blood on his cheek. The weight of what he’d done started to sink in, and he started to feel sick.",

"Wilbur, stop. Look at me.” Phil held him still, looking in his eyes. Steady, unwavering green against neurotic, desperate brown.",
"Phil felt his heart break in two. He pulled Wilbur closer, holding him tight. “I’m so sorry, Wil. God, I’m so sorry.”",
"I know what you mean about gasoline on the fire now though",
"His hands were still stained with his brother's blood.",
"“Wilbur?”\n\nNo response came.\n\n“Wilbur, can I come in?”\n\nNothing.\n\nHe opened the door cautiously, peering inside the dark room. He turned the light on, and his heart sank.\n\nA gentle breeze blew through the open window.",

"“Run away with me.”\n\n“You lost your fuckin’ mind, man.”\n\n“Just for a week or two, Schlatt, please. I can’t go home.”",
"“It doesn’t matter, Schlatt!” Wilbur laughed, high and manic. “Come on! We’ll have the week of our lives! We can sleep on the beach, we can do whatever we want!”",
"The moon hung in the sky like a mother, watching the two boys on the cliff’s edge. Black waves crashed against the rocks far below, a dull but textured noise in the air.",
"Did you ever consider you might be a kinda shitty friend?” Schlatt’s tone wasn’t angry. It was hurt.",
"Why d’you keep me around if I’m that bad?” Wilbur tried to meet his eye again, but Schlatt turned away.\n\n“I dunno. You’re all I got.”",
"The moon took away the color in the world, painting everything dark shades of blue and grey. It was big and full that night, beckoning him out to sea.",
"Schlatt looked up at the cliff’s edge, and thoughts of Wilbur flooded his brain. He scowled.\n\nWhen it was hard to move his body from the numbness, he waded back out to shore.\n\nNo one needed to know if he found warmth again in the arms of his friend.",
"“Fucking shut up, Wilbur!” Schlatt shouted, stunning Wilbur into silence. “Just shut your fucking trap for once in your life!”\n\nWilbur stared like a deer in the headlights, his heart racing.",
"I don’t wanna talk to you until you can act like a person. I’m serious.” Schlatt made eye contact with him then. Wilbur really, really wished he hadn’t.\n\n“I… I am a person”, he whispered, tears stinging his eyes.\n\n“No, Wilbur. You’re cyanide.”",
"“No, Wilbur. You’re cyanide.”",
"Wilbur stood still, watching Schlatt walk away. He didn’t look back once.",
"He heard the dull sounds of Phil talking to him, Phil crying, the grey feeling of Phil hugging him and begging him to tell him where it all went wrong.",
"Pink hair and sharp brown eyes cut through the fog. Techno was staring at him.\n\nWilbur stared back.",
"When Wilbur’s eyes fluttered open the next morning, he could almost convince himself it was all a bad dream. Then the headache hit, and when he reached under his bed for help, he found nothing.",
"Wilbur’s eyes widened as he watched Phil use the key to a padlock on the medicine cabinet. That had not been there previously./n/n“Is that really necessary?” Wilbur asked, his voice small.\n\nPhil stopped, then sighed. “Wilbur, I don’t want you to talk to me about what’s ‘necessary’.",
"“Sit down. I know you were… hungover, or in shock, or something last night, so you weren’t very good at talking. You don’t have an excuse today.” Phil said, pointing to the couch.\n\nWilbur did as he was told.",

"It was fairly neat as far as teenager’s rooms went, a yellow duvet on their bed and houseplants dotting the surfaces. Tommy’s stuff was crammed in a corner.",
"The shirt was one of Techno’s, a souvenir from the Welcome to Night Vale show he’d attended a few years back. Tommy had gotten into it after Techno went, and as Techno’s hyperfixation moved on, Tommy was rewarded with all of Techno’s merch.",
"“What the fuck is wrong with you?”\n\nThe lump in his throat grew, a pit formed in his stomach, and tears stung his eyes. “I’m sorry. I don’t know.”",
"Techno watched him go. The world lost a little more color.",
"He was quiet, far quieter than he usually was. A raging storm brewed inside him, tearing at his body and mind.",
"“Okay”, Tubbo smiled, “you’re always welcome to stay as long as you like.”",
"”You let me know if you need anything, alright little man?” Eret offered a warm smile.\n\nTommy scowled. “I’m not little.”\n\nEret and Tubbo both laughed, quiet things in the dead of night.",
"“I don’t want to go to therapy.” Tommy grumbled, burying his face in Tubbo’s shoulder again.\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“I don’t want someone in my head. That’s scary.”\n\n“They only go in to help you heal.”\n\n“Maybe I don’t want to heal.”"
