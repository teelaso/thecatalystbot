	"“Hey, Tech. Would you mind running to the store to get heavy cream?” Phil asked, looking up from his phone. “I managed to forget it. I’ll give you a ten, get something for yourself too.”",
	"\\[Techno’s room\\] was dark and for the most part, monochromatic. Grey sheets with grey pillows, grey blinds and white carpet. The LEDs on his walls were pink, though, which cast a pink light through the whole room. His blinds were shut, and clothes littered the floor.",
	"Techno laid down on the bed with a sigh. His popcorn ceilings had patterns if he looked close enough.",
	"“Oh, perfect timing. I just finished icing the cake.” Phil smiled, showing it off to Techno. \n\nIt read, “Happy Birthday Tobby”. \n\nTechno snorted. “You spelled Toby wrong.”", 
	"He changed into black jeans and a T-shirt with a smiley face on it. It had been a normal T-shirt once, but he had hung out with Dream and his friends a few weeks ago, and now all of them had smiley face T-shirts. It was drawn on with a sharpie. He liked it.",
	"“Shit. Fuck. Don’t tell Phil?”", 
	"“You’re a natural”, Wilbur joked.\n\n“I think that’s a bad thing.” Techno said, blowing smoke out into the night air.\n\nWilbur was quiet for a moment. “Yeah, probably.”",
	"“I mean it makes sense, given today.” Wilbur said, rubbing the side of his arm to warm it up.\n\n“What do you mean?” Techno asked, looking over at Wilbur.\n\nWilbur looked back at him. “What... what do you mean ‘what do you mean’. It’s the day before Christmas.”",
	"“You know I… like… care about you, right? You’re my friend. I wanna make sure you’re okay.”",
	"“Mhm. Hey, Techno?”\n\nHe paused. “Yeah? What?”\n\n“Sweet dreams. I love you.”", 
		
	"Josh L.\n23\nLooking for someone special. 🍃 and booze friendly. Heteroflexible, open to almost anything. Hmu, I talk back :D",
	"“You were there last night too. Are you planning on spending the rest of winter break there?” He asked.\n\nWilbur bristled and gritted his teeth, a sudden anger rising in him. “Jesus, I dunno! Maybe? Why do you care?”",
	"“God, you’re somehow even more beautiful in person. Come on in, the sushi just got here. Would you like a glass of wine?”\n\nMentally, Wilbur fist pumped. Free alcohol. Always a win. Almost erased the discomfort of the gendered compliment.",
	"“Yeah, I’m…” Wilbur trailed off as he felt his body sink backwards into the couch, and his vision started to lag. “Good.”",
	"“Aw, come on, I’ve barely seen you recently!” Tommy said, pulling his sleeve.\n\nWilbur froze, then yanked his hand away from his younger brother. “Don’t fucking touch me, Tommy!”",
	"He was quiet. He was very, very careful to be quiet. His whole body felt like it was on fire.",

	"The world was beginning to sway pleasantly, and Wilbur capped the bottle and returned it to the space under his bed frame. He took a deep breath and pulled out his phone. It was only 10:34 AM. He laughed a little at that, this was definitely the earliest he’d gotten plastered.",
	"It felt wrong. That was the closest way he could think to describe it. It felt deeply, terribly wrong.",
	"He pulled at his binder a little, making sure it was still in place. It felt comforting to him, like a shield that would keep unwanted touches away. The pressure he had always found annoying felt safe now.",
	"It happened in a flash- Tommy tried to hit his hands away, Wilbur’s rage sparked, and the next thing he felt was the palm of his hand stinging his brother’s face.",
	"Wilbur screamed, the feeling of hands on him sending fire through his veins. He writhed against his brother’s grip, shrieking and kicking and sobbing profanities.",
	"“Why did you hit Tommy?” Techno asked, eyeing Wilbur carefully.\n\n“I’m… ‘m not drunk”, he sniffled, pulling his beanie over his hair.\n\n“Wilbur, I’m gonna be honest, if you hit Tommy while completely sober, I’m gonna break your fuckin’ ribs. You better have an explanation.”",
	"“I’m really sorry, Tommy”, he mumbled.\n\nTommy looked at him with a mix of sympathy and cautiousness. “It’s… it’s okay. Just don’t do it again”, he said, taking a shaky breath.\n\nWilbur nodded. “Never.”",
	"By the time school started up again a few days later, his brothers had gotten used to an almost permanent state of drunkenness from Wilbur.",
	"“I’m not drunk, I’m just tired. Gimme.”\n\n“I can literally see a bottle of vodka in your backpack”",
	"“Tommy, get out.” He deadpanned.\n\nTommy shook his head.\n\n“Tommy, get out of the car. This isn’t safe.” Techno ordered.\n\nTommy shook his head again. “If Wilbur wants to die he has to kill me too.”",
	"“No! You’re going to get in a car accident and you’re going to die, if you die I want to die too!”",
	"“I don’t need you guys to be worried about me! I’m fucking fine, now get out of the car!” Wilbur yelled, glaring at Tommy.\n\n“No! I’m not going to let you kill yourself!” He cried, backing away from Wilbur even further.\n\n“Why not?!” Wilbur shouted.",
	"The car was loud, Tommy and Tubbo’s shrieks of laughter bouncing off the walls. A keen eye could tell Tommy was more reserved than usual, and a thin layer of tension surrounded the brothers.",
	"He took long swigs, desperately, and took a few deep breaths to let the feeling wash over him. It was okay. He was safe. He didn’t have to think about it if he couldn’t think.",
	"“Don’t ever drive drunk again. Even tipsy.” He said, holding out his pinky finger. “For me and Tommy. Please.”\n\nWilbur felt the words sink and weigh down his chest, but he nodded and pinky swore. “I promise”",
	"Wilbur sat alone in his room, staring at his phone. The room was dark, his usually minimalist design a wreck of dirty clothes and trash. ",
	"He took a deep breath, feeling the pressure of his binder reassure him.\n\nAlone in his room, he could almost forget the feeling of another man’s hands on his chest.\n\nAlmost.",
 
	"“Should I be worried about you?” Schlatt asked, glancing up from his phone.\n\n“No”, Wilbur scowled.",
	"Schlatt made eye contact with him, then. Wilbur wished he hadn’t. Schlatt was the only person left that he thought wouldn’t judge him. The look on his face proved otherwise.",				
	"D&D is today.” Wilbur said, readjusting his beanie.\n\n“Ah, is this the one where you all have countries?” Phil grinned.\n\nWilbur scoffed. “Yeah, well, we used to. Tommy and Techno and I have a refuge, but Schlatt kicked us out.",
	"“Tommy, am I a- am I a bad- am I a villain?” Wilbur asked, his voice breaking at the words.\n\nTommy paused, looking at his brother. He hesitated, watching the glint of honesty in Wilbur’s eyes.\n\n“No.”\n\n“Why not?”",
	"He looked like he was asking for something like he was asking for forgiveness. Tommy blinked and shook his head, trying to reset his brain. This wasn’t about real life. This was fictional, if Wilbur wanted to have this conversation, he would need to take it seriously.",
	"Just like that, the honesty dissipated from Wilbur’s eyes. He was back in character. He slipped back into his role with ease, the break going unnoticed by everyone else at the table.\n\nTommy almost despised him for it.",
	"“You’re not a bad guy, Wilbur.” Tommy was the first to speak.\n\nWilbur tensed. He kept his eyes on the road.\n“That was just my character, Toms.”\n\n“Was it?”\n\n“Does it matter?”\n\n“I feel like it does.”\n\n“Well, it doesn’t.”",
	"”Just because we’re related by some stupid fucking legal documents doesn’t mean you get to know every little detail of my fucking life, okay? Christ!”",
	"He punched his wall until his knuckles were red and bloody. He didn’t even make a dent.",

	"Techno hated the silence that followed. Dream was warm, and what had felt comforting seconds ago felt like hot shame now.",
	"He always hated silence with Dream. He loved it on his own, but with Dream it came with anger. An anger that settled on his skin like a layer of ash, fallen from a plume of smoke.",
	"“It didn’t feel like I was puttin’ smoke in my lungs, it felt like I was lettin’ smoke out for the first time.”",
	"“Do you ever get that feelin’? Like there used to be a fire inside you, but now it’s just smouldering away? Fillin’ you up with smoke?",
	"Dream watched a plane overhead. Tiny blinking lights, quietly crossing the sky.\n\n“No, the only time I feel the fire inside me is when someone pours in gasoline. Then I feel it through my whole body.”",
	"“I think you’re like the sun.”\n\n“One day I’m gonna explode and kill everyone?” Dream teased.\n\nTechno scoffed. “No, you’re… fiery. You’re full of passion. I think you’re so full of emotions it burns you.”",
	"“What would that make you?”\n\n“I think that would make me dark matter.”\n\n“Blocking out the stars?”\n\n“Not intentionally. It’s just in my nature”",
	"Techno studied his friend’s face. In the dark, illuminated only by the moon, his green eyes looked grey. His freckles looked like stars. Techno wished he could live among those stars.",
	"Dream returned the favor. Techno’s face was round like the moon, chubby cheeks and hooded eyelids framing dark brown eyes.",
	"“It’s rainin’.” Techno said.\n\n“We should go inside”, Dream said.\n\nThe two did not go inside. Techno rested his forehead on Dream’s, closing his eyes.",
	"“Do you believe in it?”\n\n“What, sausages?”\n\nTechno scoffed. “No, like, Christianity.”",
	"“I don’t believe in the bible, no. I do believe there’s a god, though.”\n\n“Do you think he’s kind?” Techno asked.\n\nDream didn’t have an answer for that.",
	"“You’re welcome to stay until Phil can pick you up.”\n\n“I can’t say I’ll be very entertainin’.”\n\n“I’m not friends with you for entertainment, Techno.”",
	"“Thank you, Techno. I love you.”\n\n“…I love you too, dad.”",
	"“Wilbur doesn’t hate you.”\n\n“H-He said that we’re only related because of some papers”, Tommy sobbed, leaning into Techno’s touch.\n\nTechno felt the fire in his body ignite. He gritted his teeth. “Do you want me to beat him up?”\n\n“No, I j-just want him to love me!”",
	"As the car drove away, Techno’s expression fell. Then it kept falling, until all that was left was a snarl and a fire behind his eyes.",
	"Wilbur struggled against him. “Fucking let me go, you idiot! It’s the truth!”\n\nWith those words, Wilbur poured gasoline on the fire.",
	"“Aren’t we your brothers?! How could you say that? He loves you more than he loves himself, and you fuckin’ crushed him!”",
	"“You’re a fucking psychopath, Techno. You’re sick.”",
	"Techno stood, heavy breaths shaking his body. He wiped his eyes, leaving a smear of blood on his cheek. The weight of what he’d done started to sink in, and he started to feel sick.",

	"Wilbur, stop. Look at me.” Phil held him still, looking in his eyes. Steady, unwavering green against neurotic, desperate brown.",
	"Phil felt his heart break in two. He pulled Wilbur closer, holding him tight. “I’m so sorry, Wil. God, I’m so sorry.”",
	"I know what you mean about gasoline on the fire now though",
	"His hands were still stained with his brother's blood.",
	"Techno felt the stinging pain well into his dreams.",
	"“Wilbur?”\n\nNo response came.\n\n“Wilbur, can I come in?”\n\nNothing.\n\nHe opened the door cautiously, peering inside the dark room. He turned the light on, and his heart sank.\n\nA gentle breeze blew through the open window.",

	"“Run away with me.”\n\n“You lost your fuckin’ mind, man.”\n\n“Just for a week or two, Schlatt, please. I can’t go home.”",
	"“It doesn’t matter, Schlatt!” Wilbur laughed, high and manic. “Come on! We’ll have the week of our lives! We can sleep on the beach, we can do whatever we want!”",
	"The moon hung in the sky like a mother, watching the two boys on the cliff’s edge. Black waves crashed against the rocks far below, a dull but textured noise in the air.",
	"Did you ever consider you might be a kinda shitty friend?” Schlatt’s tone wasn’t angry. It was hurt.",
	"Why d’you keep me around if I’m that bad?” Wilbur tried to meet his eye again, but Schlatt turned away.\n\n“I dunno. You’re all I got.”",
	"The moon took away the color in the world, painting everything dark shades of blue and grey. It was big and full that night, beckoning him out to sea.",
	"Schlatt looked up at the cliff’s edge, and thoughts of Wilbur flooded his brain. He scowled.\n\nWhen it was hard to move his body from the numbness, he waded back out to shore.\n\nNo one needed to know if he found warmth again in the arms of his friend.",
	"“Fucking shut up, Wilbur!” Schlatt shouted, stunning Wilbur into silence. “Just shut your fucking trap for once in your life!”\n\nWilbur stared like a deer in the headlights, his heart racing.",
	"I don’t wanna talk to you until you can act like a person. I’m serious.” Schlatt made eye contact with him then. Wilbur really, really wished he hadn’t.\n\n“I… I am a person”, he whispered, tears stinging his eyes.\n\n“No, Wilbur. You’re cyanide.”",
	"“No, Wilbur. You’re cyanide.”",
	"Wilbur stood still, watching Schlatt walk away. He didn’t look back once.",
	"He heard the dull sounds of Phil talking to him, Phil crying, the grey feeling of Phil hugging him and begging him to tell him where it all went wrong.",
	"Pink hair and sharp brown eyes cut through the fog. Techno was staring at him.\n\nWilbur stared back.",
	"When Wilbur’s eyes fluttered open the next morning, he could almost convince himself it was all a bad dream. Then the headache hit, and when he reached under his bed for help, he found nothing.",
	"Wilbur’s eyes widened as he watched Phil use the key to a padlock on the medicine cabinet. That had not been there previously./n/n“Is that really necessary?” Wilbur asked, his voice small.\n\nPhil stopped, then sighed. “Wilbur, I don’t want you to talk to me about what’s ‘necessary’.",
	"“Sit down. I know you were… hungover, or in shock, or something last night, so you weren’t very good at talking. You don’t have an excuse today.” Phil said, pointing to the couch.\n\nWilbur did as he was told.",

	"It was fairly neat as far as teenager’s rooms went, a yellow duvet on their bed and houseplants dotting the surfaces. Tommy’s stuff was crammed in a corner.",
	"The shirt was one of Techno’s, a souvenir from the Welcome to Night Vale show he’d attended a few years back. Tommy had gotten into it after Techno went, and as Techno’s hyperfixation moved on, Tommy was rewarded with all of Techno’s merch.",
	"“What the fuck is wrong with you?”\n\nThe lump in his throat grew, a pit formed in his stomach, and tears stung his eyes. “I’m sorry. I don’t know.”",
	"Techno watched him go. The world lost a little more color.",
	"He was quiet, far quieter than he usually was. A raging storm brewed inside him, tearing at his body and mind.",
	"“Okay”, Tubbo smiled, “you’re always welcome to stay as long as you like.”",
	"”You let me know if you need anything, alright little man?” Eret offered a warm smile.\n\nTommy scowled. “I’m not little.”\n\nEret and Tubbo both laughed, quiet things in the dead of night.",
	"“I don’t want to go to therapy.” Tommy grumbled, burying his face in Tubbo’s shoulder again.\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“I don’t want someone in my head. That’s scary.”\n\n“They only go in to help you heal.”\n\n“Maybe I don’t want to heal.”",

	"Every so often, his thoughts would stray from whatever meaningless content he was looking at and he would feel the world start to collapse around him.",
	"Techno couldn’t imagine it was easy, watching your son go through withdrawals for nicotine and alcohol at the same time. Knowing you hadn't even noticed it get this bad.",
	"Breaking his nose certainly hadn’t helped.\n\nNo, it had definitely made things worse.",
	"Techno would ball his fist sometimes, feel the wave of guilt that came with the simple gesture drown him.",
	"It became a routine, every night he would pray that his blood would heal his brother. It never did.",
	"“The Blade”, used to be Tommy’s nickname for him. He laughed a little at that. How morbid.",
	"Why did it hurt so much when someone knew? He felt numb while he did it, why did it feel like someone was ripping out his heart when Dream asked that?",
	"“How the hell did you do that?” Techno asked, offering him a hand and pulling him in.\n\n“I do parkour in my free time. I go rock climbing twice a year. I have the natural agility of a cat. Take your pick.”",
	"“I don’t need you to take care of me.”\n\n“I want to take care of you.” Dream insisted, meeting his eyes.\n\n“It’s rotten work”, Techno said, his voice a whisper around the lump in his throat.\n\n“Not to me”, Dream said, taking his hand. “Not if it’s you.”",
	"Dream slipped out of his window in the early morning, pale light illuminating the quiet world. The city was still damp, the clouds having moved on but left their mark.",
	"“You look tired”, Fundy said, acknowledging Techno for the first time.\n\n“Oh… yeah, I didn’t sleep last night.” Techno nodded.\n\n“Insomnia?” Fundy asked, looking over at Techno in the passenger seat.\n\nDream’s dark green and yellow eyes flashed in his mind. “Something like that.”",
	"“Techno, you can walk home, right?”\n\nTechno sighed and stood up, pulling his backpack over his shoulder. “Sure. Why not”, he mumbled.\n\n“I’m sure we can give him a-“\n\n“No, shh. He’s an arsehole, let him walk.”",
	"Techno tried not to hear it. He put his headphones in and started on his way home, trying to ignore the stinging in his thighs and the feeling of the world threatening to collapse around him.",
	"“You did this to me! You’re a fucking piece of shit, you know that, Technoblade?! You’re a fucking psychopath and you only care about yourself! You broke my fucking nose, you ruined my life!”",
	"“All you do is hurt people. You should've gone through with it.”",
	"Techno felt the world collapse around him.",

	"3:24AM\nwilbur: i miss you\n\n2:12PM\nwilbur: im sorry\n\ni wasn't trying to hurt you",
	"Error: Your message could not be delivered because you don't share a server with the recipient or you disabled direct messages on your shared server, recipient is only accepting direct messages from friends, or you were blocked by the recipient.\n\n(Not Delivered)wilbur: no no no im sorry",
	"Wilbur buried his face in his pillow and screamed, hot tears staining the sheet. He sobbed, loud and painful cries muffled by a thin layer of padding.",
	"There was a black hole inside him. There had to be. Nothing else could explain this pain, this craving.",
	"JustaMinx: I’m gonna block you if you keep saying shit like this\n\nwilbur: go ahead you’re useless to me\n\nJustaMinx: You’re fucked in the head\n\n(Not Delivered)wilbur: yeah. i know",
	"Eventually, Phil came into his room. Wilbur had never seen him so… grey. So serious.",
	"Phil stared at his eldest son. “What is wrong with you?”\n\n“Everything, obviously.”",
	"“What are you gonna do? What the fuck could you do that would affect me in the slightest? My life is in fucking shambles, Phil!” Wilbur yelled. “I don’t care! Do whatever you fucking want! Kill me!”",
	"“Wilbur, you’re not the first alcoholic in the world.”",
	"Give me your phone, and we can pretend these aren’t withdrawals. We can pretend I didn’t find empty vodka bottles under your bed, we can pretend I didn’t find cigarettes in your bedside table. We can pretend you didn’t run away for a night and come home hungover!”",
	"“You know what we’re not going to do, though? We are not going to pretend you didn’t just tell your brother to kill himself, Wilbur!”",
	"Wilbur blinked back tears, staring at his father and reminding himself again and again that Phil was different, Phil wouldn’t hurt him.",
	"“Wilbur Soot Watson, give me your phone, or I will take it from you!” Phil shouted, his voice filled with more rage and grief than Wilbur had ever heard before.",
	"Phil looked at him. Wilbur couldn’t place the emotion his expression conveyed- something somewhere between betrayal, pity, and mourning.",

	"He knew this was his last stronghold before institutionalization. He knew Phil was just as scared as he was. Techno knew he couldn’t get institutionalized- that would solidify it. It would make everything real.",
	"“Freja, have you ever self-harmed?” He asked, voice innocuous as if he hadn’t just sentenced him to the guillotine.",
	"Techno stared at the carpet. It was the plastic type of carpet, flat and hard. Grey, just like everything else.",
	"“Techno?” Phil spoke up.\n\n“…yeah?” He mumbled, not meeting his eye.\n\n“Why didn’t you come to me?” He asked. His voice was soft, quiet like Techno had never seen before.\n\nTechno felt his throat tighten again. He shrugged. “Didn’t wanna bother ya.”",
	"“Techno, I always want you to come to me when you need me. I love you more than anything in the world. You’re my son, and you will never, ever bother me, okay?”",
	"“I know it hurts”, Phil said, his own voice strained, “It hurts like nothing else right now, but I promise it won’t always hurt. I promise you, I promise it won’t always hurt. It’ll be okay one day, Techno. I swear to you.”",
	"“One day, you’re going to find the beauty in life again. You’ll laugh again, you’ll feel safe again. I promise. You have to promise you’ll hold on for that. Promise me, Techno. Promise you’ll hold on for the good days.”",
	"“You’re my world, Techno. You’re my heart. I don’t know what I would ever do without you.”",
	"It was the first time he’d felt loved- really, truly loved- in years.",
	"“I’ll put in a note saying you prefer Wilbur.” The doctor said, turning to his computer.\n\nWilbur gritted his teeth. “Prefer” his ass. It was just his name. No preference about it.",
	"“I’m not fucking psychotic”, Wilbur snarled. “I’m not- I’m not fucking bipolar! I know bipolar, my dad was bipolar, I’m not fucking like him!”",

	"“You guys are weird. I dunno. You both get really mad and sad and stuff all the time. I don’t understand how you think. It’s like you have different rules for interacting with people.”",
	"“Am I a bad person?” Wilbur asked, his voice cracking. Tommy and Techno exchanged a nervous glance. What the hell were they supposed to say to that?",
	"“I think… you do bad things. You say bad stuff. But I don’t think you’re a bad person.”",
	"“My dad was bipolar”, Wilbur said.\n\nIt took them both a second to realise he wasn’t talking about Phil. Both of them had been adopted when they were little kids, but Wilbur hadn’t been welcomed into the family until he was twelve.",
	"“Your first dad?” Techno asked.\n\n“Yeah”, Wilbur mumbled. “He was a f-fucking piece of shit. I don’t…” his throat closed up. “I don’t want to be like him.”",
	"“That’s a choice, Wilbur. It doesn’t matter if you have the same disorder as him. It’s your job to be better.”",
	"“You could start by apologisin’ to us.” Techno deadpanned, a glare settling into his eyes.\n\n“H-Have I wronged you?” Wilbur asked, his voice cracking on every word.\n\nTechno laughed. “Christ, Wilbur.",
	"Wilbur watched them go. His felt his heart grow a little heavier.",
	"“Soot, I’m gonna give you five more seconds to fuck off before I do something drastic.” Schlatt said, reaching into his inner jacket.",
	"“It doesn’t matter. Go back to them, Niki. I don’t want to hurt you too.”\n\n“You aren’t going to hurt me, Wil.”\n\n“Yes, I am!”",
	"“I’m a piece of shit, I’m an arsehole, can’t you tell?! Go back to Schlatt and Minx, Niki. Before I make you regret not listening to me.”",
	"“You… y-you’re not a bad person, Wil. This isn’t you.”\n\n“This is the only me that’s left.”",
	"“I don’t believe that.”\n\n“You should. Your blindness will be the death of you.”",
	"“Holy shit, Wilbur. You’re like, an adult, you know that, right? You know you’re eighteen? You can legally vote? You’re gonna tattle on me to our dad because I’m not lettin’ you sit with me at lunch?”",
	"Wilbur stared at him for a moment longer. Thought about taking Schlatt’s gun and putting it right between his eyes. Thought about the way his brains would splatter against the shattered back window.\nHe blinked and shook his head, pushing those thoughts out of his mind.",
	"He knew the right thing to do was to tell Phil.\n\nHe also knew that he slightly less moral thing- blackmail- would secure him a steady stream of Xanax.",
	"Do we have a deal?” He offered his hand.\n\nTechno looked between his brother- his brother, who was threatening him- and his outstretched hand. He took it and shook.\n“Yeah, we… we have a deal.”",
	"“I love you, Technoblade.” Wilbur said, his words sweet as cyanide.\n\nHe stared up at him. “I… I love you too, Wilbur.”\n\n“Good.”",

	"He glanced at Techno and felt a little spark of fear at his expression. He’d seen that expression a few times before. It was the equivalent of a giant red sign that read, “DANGER”.",
	"It felt a little silly, really, considering Tommy was nearly half a foot taller than him. He was just… intimidating. Despite his short disposition.",
	"“Wait, why is Tommy here? Schlatt, you can’t trade one Watson out for another.”",
	"“Since when does Schlatt give a shit about anyone but Wilbur?”"
