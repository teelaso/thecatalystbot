	"He changed into black jeans and a T-shirt with a smiley face on it. It had been a normal T-shirt once, but he had hung out with Dream and his friends a few weeks ago, and now all of them had smiley face T-shirts. It was drawn on with a sharpie. He liked it.",

	"“Mhm. Hey, Techno?”\n\nHe paused. “Yeah? What?”\n\n“Sweet dreams. I love you.”"
