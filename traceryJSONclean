	"“Hey, Tech. Would you mind running to the store to get heavy cream?” Phil asked, looking up from his phone. “I managed to forget it. I’ll give you a ten, get something for yourself too.”",
	"\\[Techno’s room\\] was dark and for the most part, monochromatic. Grey sheets with grey pillows, grey blinds and white carpet. The LEDs on his walls were pink, though, which cast a pink light through the whole room. His blinds were shut, and clothes littered the floor.",
	"Techno laid down on the bed with a sigh. His popcorn ceilings had patterns if he looked close enough.",
	"“Oh, perfect timing. I just finished icing the cake.” Phil smiled, showing it off to Techno.\n\nIt read, “Happy Birthday Tobby”.\n\nTechno snorted. “You spelled Toby wrong.”",
	"He changed into black jeans and a T-shirt with a smiley face on it. It had been a normal T-shirt once, but he had hung out with Dream and his friends a few weeks ago, and now all of them had smiley face T-shirts. It was drawn on with a sharpie. He liked it.",
	"“Shit. Fuck. Don’t tell Phil?”",
	"“You’re a natural”, Wilbur joked.\n\n“I think that’s a bad thing.” Techno said, blowing smoke out into the night air.\n\nWilbur was quiet for a moment. “Yeah, probably.”",
	"“You know I… like… care about you, right? You’re my friend. I wanna make sure you’re okay.”",
	"“Mhm. Hey, Techno?”\n\nHe paused. “Yeah? What?”\n\n“Sweet dreams. I love you.”"
	
	"“You’re a bad friend, you know that?” Wilbur scoffed, getting up and pulling his once discarded shirt over his head.\n\n“Nah, you’re just jealous you don’t make bank like me. I’ll see ya later.” Schlatt said, heading off to the bathroom.",
	"Josh L.\n23\nLooking for someone special. 🍃 and booze friendly. Heteroflexible, open to almost anything. Hmu, I talk back :D",
	"“You were there last night too. Are you planning on spending the rest of winter break there?” He asked.\n\nWilbur bristled and gritted his teeth, a sudden anger rising in him. “Jesus, I dunno! Maybe? Why do you care?”",
	"“Yeah, I’m…” Wilbur trailed off as he felt his body sink backwards into the couch, and his vision started to lag. “Good.”",
	"“Aw, come on, I’ve barely seen you recently!” Tommy said, pulling his sleeve.\n\nWilbur froze, then yanked his hand away from his younger brother. “Don’t fucking touch me, Tommy!” He shouted, glaring down at him.",
	"He was quiet. He was very, very careful to be quiet. His whole body felt like it was on fire."
