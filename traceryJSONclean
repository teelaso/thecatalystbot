	"“Hey, Tech. Would you mind running to the store to get heavy cream?” Phil asked, looking up from his phone. “I managed to forget it. I’ll give you a ten, get something for yourself too.”",
	"\\[Techno’s room\\] was dark and for the most part, monochromatic. Grey sheets with grey pillows, grey blinds and white carpet. The LEDs on his walls were pink, though, which cast a pink light through the whole room. His blinds were shut, and clothes littered the floor.",
	"Techno laid down on the bed with a sigh. His popcorn ceilings had patterns if he looked close enough.",
	"“Oh, perfect timing. I just finished icing the cake.” Phil smiled, showing it off to Techno.\n\nIt read, “Happy Birthday Tobby”.\n\nTechno snorted. “You spelled Toby wrong.”",
	"He changed into black jeans and a T-shirt with a smiley face on it. It had been a normal T-shirt once, but he had hung out with Dream and his friends a few weeks ago, and now all of them had smiley face T-shirts. It was drawn on with a sharpie. He liked it.",
	"“Shit. Fuck. Don’t tell Phil?”",
	"“You’re a natural”, Wilbur joked.\n\n“I think that’s a bad thing.” Techno said, blowing smoke out into the night air.\n\nWilbur was quiet for a moment. “Yeah, probably.”",
	"“You know I… like… care about you, right? You’re my friend. I wanna make sure you’re okay.”",
	"“Mhm. Hey, Techno?”\n\nHe paused. “Yeah? What?”\n\n“Sweet dreams. I love you.”",
	
	"“You’re a bad friend, you know that?” Wilbur scoffed, getting up and pulling his once discarded shirt over his head.\n\n“Nah, you’re just jealous you don’t make bank like me. I’ll see ya later.” Schlatt said, heading off to the bathroom.",
	"Josh L.\n23\nLooking for someone special. 🍃 and booze friendly. Heteroflexible, open to almost anything. Hmu, I talk back :D",
	"“You were there last night too. Are you planning on spending the rest of winter break there?” He asked.\n\nWilbur bristled and gritted his teeth, a sudden anger rising in him. “Jesus, I dunno! Maybe? Why do you care?”",
	"“Yeah, I’m…” Wilbur trailed off as he felt his body sink backwards into the couch, and his vision started to lag. “Good.”",
	"“Aw, come on, I’ve barely seen you recently!” Tommy said, pulling his sleeve.\n\nWilbur froze, then yanked his hand away from his younger brother. “Don’t fucking touch me, Tommy!” He shouted, glaring down at him.",
	"He was quiet. He was very, very careful to be quiet. His whole body felt like it was on fire.",
	
	"It felt wrong. That was the closest way he could think to describe it. It felt deeply, terribly wrong.",
	"He pulled at his binder a little, making sure it was still in place. It felt comforting to him, like a shield that would keep unwanted touches away. The pressure he had always found annoying felt safe now.",
	"Wilbur screamed, the feeling of hands on him sending fire through his veins. He writhed against his brother’s grip, shrieking and kicking and sobbing profanities.",
	"“I’m really sorry, Tommy”, he mumbled.\n\nTommy looked at him with a mix of sympathy and cautiousness. “It’s… it’s okay. Just don’t do it again”, he said, taking a shaky breath.\n\nWilbur nodded. “Never.”",
	"“Tommy, get out.” He deadpanned.\n\nTommy shook his head.\n\n“Tommy, get out of the car. This isn’t safe.” Techno ordered.\n\nTommy shook his head again. “If Wilbur wants to die he has to kill me too.” He said, his voice cracking on every word.",
	"“No! You’re going to get in a car accident and you’re going to die, if you die I want to die too!”",
	"“You need to talk to someone.” Techno said.\n\n“I’m fine”, Wilbur mumbled.\n\n“No, you’re not. Talk to Schlatt or Niki or something, otherwise I’m telling dad you need a therapist.”",
	"The car was loud, Tommy and Tubbo’s shrieks of laughter bouncing off the walls. A keen eye could tell Tommy was more reserved than usual, and a thin layer of tension surrounded the brothers.",
	"Wilbur sat alone in his room, staring at his phone. The room was dark, his usually minimalist design a wreck of dirty clothes and trash.",
	
	"“Should I be worried about you?” Schlatt asked, glancing up from his phone.\n\n“No”, Wilbur scowled.",
	"Schlatt made eye contact with him, then. Wilbur wished he hadn’t. Schlatt was the only person left that he thought wouldn’t judge him. The look on his face proved otherwise.",
	""D&D is today.” Wilbur said, readjusting his beanie.\n\n“Ah, is this the one where you all have countries?” Phil grinned.\n\nWilbur scoffed. “Yeah, well, we used to. Tommy and Techno and I have a refuge, but Schlatt kicked us out."",
	"“Tommy, am I a- am I a bad- am I a villain?” Wilbur asked, his voice breaking at the words.\n\nTommy paused, looking at his brother. He hesitated, watching the glint of honesty in Wilbur’s eyes.\n\n“No.”\n\n“Why not?”",
	"He looked like he was asking for something like he was asking for forgiveness. Tommy blinked and shook his head, trying to reset his brain. This wasn’t about real life. This was fictional, if Wilbur wanted to have this conversation, he would need to take it seriously.",
	"Just like that, the honesty dissipated from Wilbur’s eyes. He was back in character. He slipped back into his role with ease, the break going unnoticed by everyone else at the table.\n\nTommy almost despised him for it.",
	"“You’re not a bad guy, Wilbur.” Tommy was the first to speak.\n\nWilbur tensed. He kept his eyes on the road. \n “That was just my character, Toms.”\n\n“Was it?”\n\n“Does it matter?”\n\n“I feel like it does.”\n\n“Well, it doesn’t.”",
	"”Just because we’re related by some stupid fucking legal documents doesn’t mean you get to know every little detail of my fucking life, okay? Christ!”"
